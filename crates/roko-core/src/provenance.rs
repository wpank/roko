//! Provenance tracking — who produced a signal, and should we trust it?
//!
//! Every signal carries a [`Provenance`] record that answers:
//!
//! - **Who produced this?** (agent role, model, human user, external chain)
//! - **How trusted is that producer?** (trust in `[0..1]`)
//! - **Is the data tainted?** (from untrusted external source, needs validation)
//!
//! Provenance is how Roko implements taint analysis (anti-pattern: untrusted
//! data injected into prompts) and audit trails (tracing a decision back to
//! its inputs via lineage chains).
