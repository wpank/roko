//! Learning subsystems for Roko — episodic memory, playbooks, skills, caches,
//! and pattern discovery.
//!
//! These modules consume the signal stream produced by the orchestrator and
//! agents, persist durable records of what worked, and surface reusable
//! knowledge back to the composer/router feedback loop.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`episode_logger`] — append-only JSONL record of agent turns
//! - [`playbook`] — reusable patterns extracted from episodes
//! - [`skill_library`] — structured skills agents can invoke
//! - [`context_pack_cache`] — cached composed prompts keyed by task fingerprint
//! - [`pattern_discovery`] — mining episodes for recurring shapes
