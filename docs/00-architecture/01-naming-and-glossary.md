# Naming and Glossary

> **TL;DR**: This is the canonical vocabulary reference for Roko. It now distinguishes shipping
> code from target-state design terms with explicit status tags, so docs stop describing planned
> architecture as if it already exists. Use this document when writing docs, code comments,
> interfaces, or external material. If another document disagrees, this glossary wins.
>
> **First-time readers**: this chapter is an A-Z lookup. Start here when another architecture
> doc uses a term you do not recognize, then follow the cited home doc for depth.
>
> **Public alias convention**: Some entries include a public alias used in user-facing docs, CLI
> output, and UI. The internal term remains canonical in code and architecture docs.
>
> **Source of this consolidation**: REF34 makes this file the canonical glossary chapter. See
> [tmp/refinements/34-glossary.md](../../tmp/refinements/34-glossary.md).

## Current Naming Map

Roko's naming story now mixes shipping terminology with target-state terms introduced by the
refinement series. Use the following map to distinguish what is already in the codebase from what
is still planned.

| Canonical term | Status | Use | Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Roko` | `[shipping]` | Project and framework name | `Bardo` / `Mori` (retired) |
| `Agent` | `[shipping]` | Running process or session | `Golem` (retired) |
| `Engram` | `[shipping]` | Durable record medium | `Signal` (retired durable term) |
| `Pulse` | `[planned]` | Target-state ephemeral transport medium | `Event`, `Envelope`, `Message`, `Signal` (retired wire terms) |
| `Substrate` | `[shipping]` | Storage fabric | legacy storage-only synonyms |
| `EventBus<E>` | `[shipping]` | Current live transport implementation | calling it retired |
| `Bus` | `[planned]` | Target-state transport fabric abstraction | presenting it as already shipped |
| `Topic` | `[planned]` | Target-state Pulse routing handle | `Channel`, `Subject` |
| `TopicFilter` | `[planned]` | Target-state subscription matcher | ad hoc routing filters |
| `Datum` | `[planned]` | Target-state polymorphic `Engram` or `Pulse` input | one-off sum types |
| `PulseSource` | `[planned]` | Target-state lightweight Pulse origin attribution | overloaded provenance terms |
| `Neuro` | `[shipping]` | Durable knowledge cross-cut | `Grimoire` (retired) |
| `Daimon` | `[built]` | Affect cross-cut; public alias `AffectBias` | old loop-step framing for affect |
| `Dreams` | `[built]` | Delta-speed consolidation cross-cut | treating Dreams as a loop step |
| `Mesh` | `[planned]` | Agent-network layer | `Styx` (retired) |
| `Fleet` | `[planned]` | Agent roster | `Clade` (retired) |
| `StateHub` | `[built]` | Current dashboard/event hub; target-state projection layer over Bus + Substrate | TUI-only framing |
| `TypedContext` | `[planned]` | Structured domain situation payload; public alias `Situation` | free-text-only context matching |
| `Calibrator` | `[planned]` | Target-state learning logic split from `Policy` | treating `Policy` as both control and learning |

## Conventions

- Terms in **bold** at the start of each entry are the canonical form.
- `Code terms` stay in backticks.
- Status tags use four labels:
  - `[shipping]` = working type, module, or behavior in the current codebase.
  - `[built]` = code exists, but the glossary term overstates how fully it is wired.
  - `[planned]` = target-state design term with no corresponding shipped type or runtime path yet.
  - `[retired]` = historical term deliberately replaced by newer vocabulary.
- Each entry cites a home doc. Refinement proposals use bare filenames in the label and a link
  to `tmp/refinements/...`; canonical architecture chapters use normal doc links.
- `Public alias:` marks the clearer user-facing name to use in docs, CLI output, and UI while
  keeping the glossary term canonical in code and architecture prose.
- `(historical)` marks a retired or legacy term that may still appear in old docs or code.
- `(new)` marks a term introduced by the refinement series.
- Retired terms belong only in explicitly retired, historical, deprecated, legacy, formerly,
  old-name, renamed, or see-also contexts.

## A

**Active inference** — Predict-publish-correct loop carried across operators with `prediction.*`,
`outcome.*`, and `prediction.error.*` Pulses. Home: [10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops](../../tmp/refinements/10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops.md).

**ACT** — Step 4 of the seven-step universal loop: execute the composed Engram as an LLM call,
tool call, or chain call. Produces Pulses and usually a final durable Engram. Home:
[05-loop-retold](../../tmp/refinements/05-loop-retold.md) and
[Universal Cognitive Loop](./09-universal-cognitive-loop.md).

**Agent** — Running process or session that drives the universal loop end to end. Formerly `Golem`.
Home: [docs/00-architecture/12-five-layer-taxonomy.md](./12-five-layer-taxonomy.md).

**Agent mesh** — Peer-to-peer layer for inter-agent coordination over transport topics.
Formerly `Styx`. Phase 2+. Home: [09-phase-2-implications](../../tmp/refinements/09-phase-2-implications.md).

**Algedonic signal** — Cross-layer alarm that bypasses normal hierarchy when lower layers are
failing; emitted as a priority Pulse. Home:
[10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops](../../tmp/refinements/10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops.md).

**Annotation** — Typed human-authored Engram attached to another artifact such as an episode,

[Rich UX Primitives](../12-interfaces/23-rich-ux-primitives.md).

**ASSESS** — Step 2 of the seven-step loop: joint `Scorer` and `Router` pass that chooses the
next action and records confidence. Home: [05-loop-retold](../../tmp/refinements/05-loop-retold.md).

**Attestation** [built] — Cryptographic signature over an Engram `ContentHash`. The shipped code
already has `Attestation`, `ChainAttestation`, and sign/verify support; the level taxonomy
(`LocalAgent`, `OrgRole`, `ChainWitness`) is target-state. Home:
[32-safety-sandbox-provenance](../../tmp/refinements/32-safety-sandbox-provenance.md) and
[Provenance and Attestation](./05-provenance-and-attestation.md).

**Authorization** [built] — The current shipping safety layer authorizes actions through
`SafetyLayer::check_pre_execution()`, `AgentContract`, and `AgentWarrant`. The
`authorize(principal, action, target, ctx)` signature is target-state shorthand for that decision
boundary. Home:
[32-safety-sandbox-provenance](../../tmp/refinements/32-safety-sandbox-provenance.md).

## B

name. Home: [07-naming](../../tmp/refinements/07-naming.md).

**EventBus** [shipping] — Current live generic broadcast-channel transport abstraction in

## Retired / Deprecated Terms

These terms may appear in historical code or older docs, but they are retired and should not be
used in new work except in explicitly retired, deprecated, historical, legacy, old-name, or
formerly-marked contexts.

| Old | Replaced by | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `Signal` (retired durable term) | `Engram` | Durable-record rename already landed |
| `Signal` (retired ephemeral candidate) | `Pulse` | Do not reuse `Signal` for the wire medium |
| `Envelope<E>` (historical wrapper name) | `Pulse` | Internal wrapper name leaked into architecture prose |
| `Message` (retired wire term) | `Pulse` for transport, `ChatMessage` for LLM transcripts | `Message` is overloaded |
| `Event` (retired wire term) | `Pulse` | Too generic and collides with framework vocabulary |
| `Bardo`, `Mori` (retired project codenames) | `Roko` | Retired project codenames |
| `Golem` (retired runtime-entity name) | `Agent` | Retired runtime-entity name |
| `Styx` (retired umbrella term) | `Mesh` + `Korai` | One umbrella term split into two clearer concepts |
| `Grimoire` (retired knowledge-cross-cut name) | `Neuro` | Retired knowledge-cross-cut name |
| `Clade` (retired roster term) | `Fleet` | `Fleet` is the conventional roster term |
| `Signal = Engram` disclaimer (retired) | remove the disclaimer | `Engram` and `Pulse` are distinct mediums |
| retired lifecycle framing like `mortal`, `death`, or `reincarnation` | remove the framing | Use custody, export/import, resource, or budget language instead |

`EventBus<E>` is intentionally not in the retired table. It is the live transport implementation in
the codebase today. Use `EventBus<E>` when referring to current code and `Bus` only when discussing
the target-state abstraction proposed by the refinement docs.

## Terms Deliberately Not Defined Here

Some words still use ordinary engineering meaning rather than a formal Roko-specific definition:

- `session` in the OIDC or HTTP sense
- `task` in the general async-runtime sense
- `model` when the text clearly means an LLM, not a runtime or mental model
- `cost` when the text simply means currency spend

If any of those starts behaving like a technical term in architecture prose, promote it into
this glossary in the same change.

## Maintenance

- Every new technical term introduced in a refinement or architecture doc should add a glossary
  entry in the same change.
- Retiring a term moves it into the retired table with a reason.
- Cross-references elsewhere in `docs/` should use the spellings in this chapter.
- Review this chapter whenever a new primitive, cross-cut, interface surface, or safety concept
  becomes load-bearing.
