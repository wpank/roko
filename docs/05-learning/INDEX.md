## Overview

The learning subsystem turns every agent execution into training data. Each agent turn produces an episode, each episode updates baselines, each baseline informs routing, each routing decision produces a new episode — closing the loop. REF10 adds a Bus-backed predict-publish-correct loop: operators publish prediction Pulses, outcomes close the loop, and `prediction.error.*` becomes a first-class calibration signal. REF16 extends that loop into research ingestion: papers become Engrams, claims become testable hypotheses with falsifiers, and replication ledgers feed back into calibration instead of leaving research as folklore. See `../../tmp/refinements/10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops.md`, `../../tmp/refinements/16-research-to-runtime.md`, and [Naming and Glossary](../00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md) for the Bus/Pulse and research vocabulary. The compound effect of 11+ interconnected learning subsystems operating simultaneously is that Roko improves autonomously: better prompts, cheaper model routing, fewer repeated mistakes, monotonically growing capabilities.

REF12 extends that learning story with demurrage-governed freshness for playbooks and distilled knowledge: useful rules keep earning `balance`, stale ones cool and eventually leave the hot path, and retention is driven by use rather than a fixed-age window. See also [tmp/refinements/12-knowledge-demurrage.md](../../tmp/refinements/12-knowledge-demurrage.md), [04-decay-variants](../00-architecture/04-decay-variants.md), and [25-attention-as-currency](../00-architecture/25-attention-as-currency.md).

REF14 adds a first-class belief layer on top of those loops: `Heuristic` Engrams with explicit preconditions, predictions, falsifier surfaces, and calibration records. Matching heuristics are injected as advisory priors, outcome Pulses update their track record, worldview clusters keep multiple coherent prior sets alive, and playbooks become the concrete downstream projection rather than the only durable learning surface. See [19-heuristics-worldviews-and-falsifiers](19-heuristics-worldviews-and-falsifiers.md), `../../tmp/refinements/14-worldview-validation.md`, and [Naming and Glossary](../00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md).

REF16 adds the research-to-runtime pipeline underneath those beliefs: paper Engrams carry provenance, claims carry falsifiers, trial results become replication-ledger entries, and claim-resolved runtime parameters stay auditable through a `claim!`-style lookup instead of hardcoded literals. See [20-research-to-runtime](20-research-to-runtime.md), `../../tmp/refinements/16-research-to-runtime.md`, and [Naming and Glossary](../00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md).

The subsystem is organized around four durable learning surfaces (episodes → patterns → heuristics/worldviews → playbook projections), three bandit algorithms for online decision-making (UCB1, LinUCB, Track-and-Stop), a three-stage cascade router for model selection (Static → Confidence → UCB), and eight cybernetic feedback loops that connect the subsystems into a self-regulating whole.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Three concerns span the entire learning subsystem and must be addressed holistically rather than within individual documents.

### Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention

As Roko learns new patterns and skills, it must not forget previously learned knowledge. Three mechanisms prevent catastrophic forgetting:

1. **Append-only storage**: Episodes, costs, and metrics are never overwritten. New learning adds to the knowledge base without modifying historical records. This is the simplest and most robust anti-forgetting mechanism.

2. **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for bandits**: When bandit parameters are updated, critical historical parameters (those that contributed most to past successes) receive higher regularization, resisting change. Inspired by Kirkpatrick et al. 2017.

```rust
pub struct EWCRegularizer {
    /// Fisher information diagonal per bandit arm.
    pub fisher_diag: HashMap<String, Vec<f64>>,
    /// Reference parameters (from last consolidation).
    pub reference_params: HashMap<String, Vec<f64>>,
    /// Regularization strength (default: 100.0).
    pub lambda: f64,
    /// Consolidation interval (default: every 100 episodes).
    pub consolidate_every: u32,
}
```

3. **Confidence decay floor**: Playbook rules have a minimum confidence of 0.10 before pruning. This means a rule must be actively contradicted (not just unused) before removal. Unused rules persist indefinitely at their last confidence level.

### Curriculum Learning for Task Ordering

The plan executor currently runs tasks in dependency order. Curriculum learning (Bengio et al. 2009) suggests that ordering tasks by difficulty — easy first, hard later — accelerates learning because early successes build the skill library and playbook rules that help with harder tasks.

```rust
pub struct CurriculumScheduler {
    /// Difficulty estimator for tasks.
    pub difficulty_model: DifficultyModel,
    /// Curriculum mode.
    pub mode: CurriculumMode,
    /// Current curriculum epoch (resets when a new plan starts).
    pub epoch: u32,
}

pub enum CurriculumMode {
    /// Tasks ordered easy→hard within each dependency level.
    EasyFirst,
    /// Tasks ordered hard→easy (anti-curriculum, for stress testing).
    HardFirst,
    /// Interleaved: alternate easy and hard tasks.
    Interleaved,
    /// Adaptive: start easy, increase difficulty as pass rate improves.
    Adaptive { target_pass_rate: f64 },
}

pub struct DifficultyModel {
    /// Per-(role, complexity, crate) historical pass rate.
    pass_rates: HashMap<(String, String, String), f64>,
    /// HDC similarity to historically difficult episodes.
    difficulty_hdc: Option<HdcVector>,
}
```

Difficulty estimation uses three signals:
- **Historical pass rate** for the `(role, complexity, crate)` triple — lower pass rate = harder
- **HDC similarity** to previously failed episodes — higher similarity = likely harder
- **Dependency depth** — tasks with many dependencies tend to be harder (more constraints)

### Learning Rate Scheduling

Different learning subsystems should adapt at different rates depending on their maturity:

| Subsystem | Cold Start Rate | Warm Rate | Mature Rate |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Cascade router | High (explore aggressively) | Medium (balance) | Low (exploit) |
| Pattern miner | High (discover patterns) | Medium (validate) | Low (maintain) |
| Skill library | Medium (accumulate) | Medium (validate) | Low (curate) |
| Playbook rules | Low (cautious promotion) | Medium (active validation) | High (aggressive pruning) |

```rust
pub struct LearningRateSchedule {
    /// Episode count thresholds for phase transitions.
    pub cold_threshold: u32,   // default: 50
    pub warm_threshold: u32,   // default: 200
    /// Per-subsystem rate multipliers.
    pub rates: HashMap<String, PhaseRates>,
}

pub struct PhaseRates {
    pub cold: f64,   // rate multiplier during cold start
    pub warm: f64,   // rate multiplier during warm phase
    pub mature: f64, // rate multiplier during mature phase
}
```

This ensures that the system explores aggressively during cold start (building its initial knowledge base) and becomes increasingly conservative as it matures (preserving proven configurations while making incremental improvements).

### Meta-Learning for Tool Use

Roko agents use tools (Read, Write, Bash, etc.) with varying effectiveness. Meta-learning tracks which tool sequences lead to successful outcomes for different task types, then biases tool selection in agent prompts.

```rust
pub struct ToolUsageProfile {
    /// Per-(role, task_category): tool sequence patterns that correlate with success.
    pub success_patterns: HashMap<(String, String), Vec<ToolSequencePattern>>,
    /// Tools that are frequently called but rarely contribute to success.
    pub low_value_tools: Vec<ToolWarning>,
}

pub struct ToolSequencePattern {
    /// Ordered tool sequence (e.g., ["Read", "Edit", "Bash:cargo test"]).
    pub sequence: Vec<String>,
    /// How often this sequence appears in successful episodes.
    pub support: u32,
    /// Pass rate when this sequence is used vs when it's not.
    pub lift: f64,
}

pub struct ToolWarning {
    pub tool_name: String,
    pub calls_per_episode: f64,
    pub contribution_to_success: f64,  // near 0.0 = tool isn't helping
    pub tokens_consumed: u64,
}
```

Tool usage profiles are injected into agent prompts as hints: "For this task type, successful approaches typically use Read→Edit→Bash(test) in that order. Avoid excessive use of [tool] which historically doesn't contribute to success."

## Quick Start

To enable learning in a Roko project:

```bash
# Initialize .roko directory (creates .roko/learn/ subdirectory)
cargo run -p roko-cli -- init

# Execute plans — learning subsystems update automatically
cargo run -p roko-cli -- plan run plans/

# View learning status
cargo run -p roko-cli -- dashboard
```

Learning is automatic: every agent turn updates all subsystems through the `LearningRuntime`. No manual configuration is needed beyond `roko init`.

### Inspecting Learning State

```bash
# View episode count and recent episodes
ls -la .roko/learn/episodes.jsonl

# View cost summary
wc -l .roko/learn/costs.jsonl

# View skill library
cat .roko/learn/skills.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -50

# View cascade router state (current stage, observations)
cat .roko/learn/cascade-router.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -20

# View playbook rules
cat .roko/learn/playbook-rules.toml
```
