# 08 — Extension System

> Extension = Cell that intercepts another Cell's pipeline. Every data flow through an Extension is tagged with its capability provenance. Extensions cannot launder capabilities.

**Subsumes**: Extension trait, hook chain, extension loading, extension registry.

**Depends on**: [01-SIGNAL](01-SIGNAL.md) (Signal/Pulse duality), [02-CELL](02-CELL.md) (Cell trait, capabilities), [04-SPECIALIZATIONS](04-SPECIALIZATIONS.md) (Extension definition), [07-AGENT-RUNTIME](07-AGENT-RUNTIME.md) (9-step pipeline, CorticalState)

---

## 1. What Is an Extension?

An **Extension** is a Cell that intercepts another Cell's pipeline. It does not replace or wrap the target Cell — it hooks into the runtime's execution path at well-defined points, observing and modifying data as it flows through.

Extensions are the specialization mechanism for Agents. Two Agents with the same 9-step pipeline Graph but different Extension chains behave differently. A coding Agent loads `git`, `compiler`, and `test-runner` Extensions. A research Agent loads `web-search`, `citation`, and `summarizer` Extensions. The pipeline is the same; the interceptors differ.

### Key distinction from other specializations

| Specialization | Relationship to target |
|---|---|
| **Lens** | Observes without modifying (read-only via Observe protocol) |
| **Connector** | Provides bidirectional I/O with external systems (Connect protocol) |
| **Extension** | Intercepts and modifies the target's pipeline (hook-based interception) |

A Lens cannot change what it sees. A Connector provides capability. An Extension modifies behavior.

### Signal vs Pulse in Extensions

Extensions operate on **two mediums** depending on their layer (see [doc-01](01-SIGNAL.md)):

- **L1 Perception** and **L5 Social** layers receive **Pulses** (ephemeral). Incoming messages, observations, and outgoing communications arrive as Pulses on the Bus. Extensions in these layers filter, transform, or observe Pulses before they are graduated to Signals (if the graduation policy selects them) or consumed ephemerally.
- **L2 Memory**, **L3 Cognition**, **L4 Action**, and **L6 Meta** layers operate on **Signals** (durable). Knowledge retrieval, inference requests, tool calls, and reflection all work with persisted, scored, lineage-tracked Signals.
- **L0 Foundation** and **L7 Recovery** are lifecycle layers that operate on neither medium directly — they manage Agent state and error handling.

This distinction matters: an L1 Extension that drops a Pulse has no audit trail (the Pulse was ephemeral). An L4 Extension that blocks an action operates on a Signal that exists in the audit DAG.

---

## 2. CaMeL IFC Integration

Every data flow through an Extension is tagged with its **capability provenance** via CaMeL information flow control (IFC). Extensions cannot launder capabilities — they cannot elevate the privilege of data that passes through them.

See [doc-17 (Security Model)](17-SECURITY-MODEL.md) for the full CaMeL IFC specification.

### CamelTag structure

```rust
pub struct CamelTag {
    pub capabilities: CapabilitySet,     // what this data is allowed to do
    pub provenance: Vec<ProvenanceEntry>,// ordered chain of handlers
    pub taint_level: TaintLevel,         // Trusted, Local, External, Untrusted
}

pub struct ProvenanceEntry {
    pub handler: String,                 // extension or block name
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub operation: TagOperation,         // Passthrough, Transform, Merge
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
pub enum TaintLevel {
    Trusted,     // system-generated
    Local,       // locally verified
    External,    // from external source
    Untrusted,   // unverified external
}
```

### Tag propagation rules

1. **Input tags propagate.** When a Pulse or Signal enters an Extension hook, it carries capability tags from its origin. An L1 `filter_input()` hook receives a Pulse tagged with `{taint: Untrusted, capabilities: {read}}`. The Extension cannot strip these tags.

2. **Extensions cannot elevate.** An Extension's output inherits the **intersection** of its own capability grants and its input's capability tags. If an Extension has `{taint: Local}` and receives data tagged `{taint: Untrusted}`, the output is tagged `{taint: Untrusted}`. The lower trust level wins.

3. **Decision enums carry tags.** When `FilterDecision::Transform` replaces a message, the replacement inherits the original's capability tags plus the Extension's own provenance entry. When `ToolDecision::Substitute` replaces a tool call, the substitute carries both the original request's tags and the Extension's tags.

4. **Audit trail.** Every capability tag transformation is logged as a Pulse on `extension:{name}:ifc` topic. The CaMeL monitor (a Verify-protocol Cell, see [doc-17](17-SECURITY-MODEL.md)) subscribes to these topics and flags violations.

### No-laundering guarantee

```
Untrusted input Pulse
    |
    v
Extension "web-search" (L1 Perception)
    |  Cannot strip {taint: Untrusted} tag
    |  Can ADD its own provenance: {handler: web-search}
    v
Output Pulse: {taint: Untrusted, provenance: [web-search]}
    |
    v
Extension "summarizer" (L3 Cognition)
    |  Cannot elevate to {taint: Local}
    |  Output inherits: {taint: Untrusted, provenance: [web-search, summarizer]}
    v
Signal in context: still marked Untrusted
```

A downstream Verify-protocol Cell can see that this Signal originated from untrusted external data, regardless of how many Extensions processed it. The provenance chain is intact.

---

## 3. Extension Manifest

Every Extension declares its identity, layer, dependencies, optionality, and packaging tier through a manifest.

```rust
pub struct ExtensionManifest {
    pub name: String,                    // stable identifier, kebab-case
    pub version: Version,                // semver
    pub description: String,
    pub layer: ExtensionLayer,
    pub depends_on: Vec<String>,         // within same layer
    pub optional: bool,                  // if true, agent continues on load failure
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
    pub tier: PackageTier,               // see doc-14 for 5-tier SPI
}
```

### Packaging tiers

Extensions follow the **5-tier SPI** defined in [doc-14 (Config and Authoring)](14-CONFIG-AND-AUTHORING.md). The tier determines sandboxing, distribution, and trust level:

| Tier | Extension Form | Sandboxing | Distribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Prompts** | Markdown/TOML front-matter declaring hook behavior | None (no execution) | Marketplace |
| **2. Config** | TOML profile bundles that configure built-in Extensions | None | Marketplace |
| **3. Declarative tools** | TOML manifests for subprocess/HTTP/MCP hooks, sandboxed | OS-level process isolation | Verified publishers |
| **4. WASM** | Compiled WASM implementing Extension hooks | WASM sandbox (fuel-metered) | Marketplace (recommended) |
| **5. Native Rust** | `impl Extension for MyExt` compiled in-tree | Process-level | In-tree only |

Most third-party Extensions should target Tier 4 (WASM). Tiers 1-3 cover common cases without writing code. Tier 5 is reserved for built-in Extensions and trusted in-tree plugins. See [doc-14](14-CONFIG-AND-AUTHORING.md) for authoring details at each tier.

### TOML authoring

```toml
# .roko/extensions/report-writer/manifest.toml
[extension]
name = "report-writer"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Generates structured reports from agent output"
layer = "action"
depends_on = ["citation", "summarizer"]
optional = true
tier = "wasm"
tags = ["reporting", "documentation"]
```

---

## 4. The 8 Layers

Extensions are organized into 8 layers. Each layer has a defined purpose and fires at a specific point in the Agent's 9-step pipeline ([doc-07 SS8](07-AGENT-RUNTIME.md)).

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
pub enum ExtensionLayer {
    Foundation,   // L0 -- Lifecycle setup and teardown
    Perception,   // L1 -- Input filtering and observation (Pulse medium)
    Memory,       // L2 -- Knowledge access interception (Signal medium)
    Cognition,    // L3 -- LLM call modification (Signal medium)
    Action,       // L4 -- Tool and action interception (Signal medium)
    Social,       // L5 -- Communication interception (Pulse medium)
    Meta,         // L6 -- Self-monitoring (Signal medium)
    Recovery,     // L7 -- Error handling
}
```

### Layer-to-pipeline mapping

| Layer | # | Pipeline Steps | When it fires | Medium |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation | L0 | Init / Shutdown | Agent startup and teardown | N/A (lifecycle) |
| Perception | L1 | Step 1 (Observe) | After observations gathered, before analysis | **Pulse** |
| Memory | L2 | Step 2 (Retrieve) | During knowledge retrieval and storage | Signal |
| Cognition | L3 | Steps 4-5 (Gate, Simulate) | Before/after LLM inference, during gating | Signal |
| Action | L4 | Step 7 (Execute) | Before/after tool calls and actions | Signal |
| Social | L5 | Steps 1, 7 (Observe, Execute) | On message send/receive | **Pulse** |
| Meta | L6 | Step 9 (Reflect) | During reflection and cost accounting | Signal |
| Recovery | L7 | Any step (on error) | On errors and budget exhaustion | N/A (error path) |

The Perception and Social layers operate on the React layer's medium -- **Pulses** (see [doc-02](02-CELL.md)). This is consistent with the React protocol operating on Pulses rather than Signals. Observations and communications are ephemeral events; they become Signals only through explicit graduation.

---

## 5. The 22 Hooks

The Extension trait provides 22 hooks across the 8 layers. All hooks have default no-op implementations -- an Extension only overrides the hooks it needs.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Extension: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn layer(&self) -> ExtensionLayer;

    // -- L0: Foundation ---------------------------------------------------
    async fn on_init(&mut self, ctx: &mut AgentContext) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn on_shutdown(&mut self, ctx: &mut AgentContext) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }

    // -- L1: Perception (Pulse medium) ------------------------------------
    async fn on_observe(&self, obs: &mut Observations) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn filter_input(&self, input: &mut AgentMessage) -> Result<FilterDecision> {
        Ok(FilterDecision::Pass)
    }

    // -- L2: Memory (Signal medium) ---------------------------------------
    async fn on_retrieve(&self, query: &str, results: &mut Vec<Signal>) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn on_store(&self, signal: &Signal) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }

    // -- L3: Cognition (Signal medium) ------------------------------------
    async fn pre_inference(&self, req: &mut InferenceRequest) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn post_inference(&self, resp: &mut InferenceResponse) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn on_gate(&self, decision: &mut GateDecision) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }

    // -- L4: Action (Signal medium) ---------------------------------------
    async fn pre_action(&self, action: &mut Action) -> Result<ActionDecision> {
        Ok(ActionDecision::Proceed)
    }
    async fn post_action(&self, action: &Action, result: &ActionResult) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn on_tool_call(&self, call: &mut ToolCall) -> Result<ToolDecision> {
        Ok(ToolDecision::Allow)
    }

    // -- L5: Social (Pulse medium) ----------------------------------------
    async fn on_message_send(&self, msg: &mut AgentMessage) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn on_message_receive(&self, msg: &AgentMessage) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }

    // -- L6: Meta (Signal medium) -----------------------------------------
    async fn on_reflect(&self, state: &CorticalState) -> Result<Vec<Adjustment>> {
        Ok(vec![])
    }
    async fn on_cost_update(&self, usage: &Usage) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }

    // -- L7: Recovery -----------------------------------------------------
    async fn on_error(&self, error: &AgentError) -> Result<RecoveryAction> {
        Ok(RecoveryAction::Propagate)
    }
    async fn on_budget_exceeded(&self, usage: &Usage) -> Result<BudgetAction> {
        Ok(BudgetAction::Sleepwalk)
    }

    // -- Cross-cutting: lifecycle events ----------------------------------
    async fn on_tick_start(&self, tick: u64, regime: Regime) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn on_tick_end(&self, tick: u64, regime: Regime) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    async fn on_slot_assigned(&self, slot: &SlotName, task: &TaskAssignment) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
    async fn on_slot_completed(&self, slot: &SlotName, result: &TaskResult) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Hook count by layer

| Layer | Hooks | Count | Medium |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 Foundation | `on_init`, `on_shutdown` | 2 | N/A |
| L1 Perception | `on_observe`, `filter_input` | 2 | Pulse |
| L2 Memory | `on_retrieve`, `on_store` | 2 | Signal |
| L3 Cognition | `pre_inference`, `post_inference`, `on_gate` | 3 | Signal |
| L4 Action | `pre_action`, `post_action`, `on_tool_call` | 3 | Signal |
| L5 Social | `on_message_send`, `on_message_receive` | 2 | Pulse |
| L6 Meta | `on_reflect`, `on_cost_update` | 2 | Signal |
| L7 Recovery | `on_error`, `on_budget_exceeded` | 2 | N/A |
| Cross-cutting | `on_tick_start`, `on_tick_end`, `on_slot_assigned`, `on_slot_completed` | 4 | N/A |
| **Total** | | **22** | |

---

## 6. Decision Enums

Six hooks return decision values that control pipeline behavior. All other hooks return `Result<()>` (observation-only).

### FilterDecision (L1: Perception)

Returned by `filter_input()`. Controls whether an incoming Pulse reaches the Agent's pipeline.

```rust
pub enum FilterDecision {
    /// Pulse passes through unchanged.
    Pass,
    /// Pulse is silently discarded. Logged for debugging.
    Drop,
    /// Pulse is replaced with a transformed version.
    /// CaMeL IFC: replacement inherits original's capability tags.
    Transform(AgentMessage),
}
```

**Behavioral consequence**: `Drop` causes the Pulse to never reach the Agent's pipeline. The runtime logs `"Message dropped by extension {name}"` at DEBUG level. The sender receives no notification.

### ActionDecision (L4: Action)

Returned by `pre_action()`. Controls whether an action executes.

```rust
pub enum ActionDecision {
    /// Action executes normally.
    Proceed,
    /// Action is halted. Not an error -- an intentional veto.
    Cell { reason: String },
    /// Action is replaced with a modified version.
    /// CaMeL IFC: replacement inherits original's capability tags.
    Modify(Action),
}
```

**Behavioral consequence**: `Cell` halts the action but the Agent continues. The Agent receives `"Action blocked by {extension_name}: {reason}"` in its next turn, allowing it to choose an alternative. This is the primary mechanism for safety Extensions to prevent dangerous operations.

### ToolDecision (L4: Action)

Returned by `on_tool_call()`. Controls whether a specific tool call executes.

```rust
pub enum ToolDecision {
    /// Tool call proceeds as requested.
    Allow,
    /// Tool call is blocked. Logged, Agent is notified.
    Cell { reason: String },
    /// Tool call is transparently replaced with a different call.
    /// CaMeL IFC: substitute carries both original and Extension tags.
    Substitute(ToolCall),
}
```

**Behavioral consequence**: `Substitute` replaces the original tool call transparently. The Agent sees the substitute's result as if it had made the substitute call originally. This enables tool wrapping (e.g., replacing `rm -rf` with a safer alternative).

### RecoveryAction (L7: Recovery)

Returned by `on_error()`. Controls error handling behavior.

```rust
pub enum RecoveryAction {
    /// Error propagates up the call stack (default).
    Propagate,
    /// Retry the failed operation.
    Retry,
    /// Suppress the error. Agent continues as if nothing happened.
    Ignore,
    /// Escalate with a custom message (e.g., notify human).
    Escalate(String),
}
```

### BudgetAction (L7: Recovery)

Returned by `on_budget_exceeded()`. Controls behavior when the Agent's budget runs out.

```rust
pub enum BudgetAction {
    /// Enter sleepwalk mode: observe and reflect only, no LLM calls.
    Sleepwalk,
    /// Shut down the Agent gracefully.
    Stop,
    /// Request additional budget (amount in microdollars).
    RequestMore(u64),
}
```

### Adjustment (L6: Meta)

Returned by `on_reflect()`. Requests modifications to the Agent's cortical state.

```rust
pub enum Adjustment {
    /// Replace or add a goal in the Agent's goal set.
    SetGoal(Goal),
    /// Update a belief key-value pair.
    UpdateBelief(String, f64),
    /// Shift the Agent's attention focus.
    ShiftAttention(String),
}
```

---

## 7. Hook Execution Order

Per tick, Extensions fire in **layer order**: L0 (Foundation) through L7 (Recovery). Within a layer, Extensions fire in **dependency order** first (topological sort), then **config order** (the order they appear in the `extensions = [...]` array in `roko.toml`).

### Short-circuiting

Decision hooks can short-circuit the chain:

- `FilterDecision::Drop` -- remaining perception Extensions still fire (they see the drop), but the Pulse is discarded after the chain completes.
- `ActionDecision::Block` -- remaining action Extensions in the chain are **skipped**. The block is final.
- `ToolDecision::Block` -- same as ActionDecision::Block. Chain is skipped.

Non-decision hooks (returning `Result<()>`) never short-circuit. All Extensions in the layer fire regardless.

### CaMeL IFC during execution

Throughout the hook chain, capability tags propagate according to the rules in section 2. The runtime maintains a `TagContext` per tick that accumulates provenance as data flows through Extensions. This context is available to the CaMeL monitor for post-hoc audit.

---

## 8. Fault Isolation

If one Extension's hook returns `Err`, the runtime logs the error and continues to the next Extension. A buggy optional Extension cannot take down the Agent.

### Rules

1. **Hook errors are not Agent errors.** A single Extension failure does not trigger the Recovery layer. The error is logged and the pipeline continues.
2. **Decision defaults apply on error.** If `pre_action` errors, the default `ActionDecision::Proceed` is used. If `on_error` errors, the default `RecoveryAction::Propagate` is used.
3. **Repeated failures trigger circuit breaking.** If an Extension's hooks fail 5 times consecutively, the runtime disables it for the remainder of the session and logs a warning:

```
[WARN] Extension "flaky-ext" disabled after 5 consecutive hook failures.
       Agent continues with reduced extension chain.
```

4. **Required vs optional distinction is for loading only.** Once loaded, all Extensions follow the same fault isolation rules. The `optional` flag controls startup behavior, not runtime behavior.
5. **CaMeL tag propagation survives failures.** If an Extension hook fails, the runtime uses the input's capability tags as the output's tags (pass-through). No capability elevation occurs from error handling.

---

## 9. Hook Timeout

All Extension hooks timeout after **5 seconds** (default). This is configurable per Extension.

```toml
[extensions.slow-analyzer]
timeout_ms = 15000  # 15 seconds (default: 5000)
```

A timeout is treated as a hook error and follows the fault isolation rules in section 8. The Extension's hook is cancelled via the CancellationToken, and the next Extension in the chain fires.

---

## 10. Extension Loading and Discovery

Extensions are loaded from three sources, checked in order.

| Source | Location | Format | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Built-in** | Compiled into the roko binary | Rust code (static dispatch) -- Tier 5 | 1st (always available) |
| **Local** | `.roko/extensions/{name}/` | Any tier (TOML manifest + implementation) | 2nd |
| **Registry** | Fetched from relay extension registry | Downloaded to `.roko/extensions/`, then loaded as local | 3rd (on first use) |

### Load order

1. Built-in Extensions load first. These are always available and cannot fail to load.
2. Local Extensions from disk. The runtime scans `.roko/extensions/` for manifest files.
3. Registry Extensions are fetched only if referenced in config but not found locally.

### Registry fetch flow

```
Config references "vuln-scanner"
         |
         v
Check .roko/extensions/vuln-scanner/
         |
    found --> Load per tier (TOML / WASM / native)
         |
    not found
         |
         v
GET {relay_url}/registry/extensions/vuln-scanner
         |
         v
Download to .roko/extensions/vuln-scanner/
         |
         v
Verify SHA-256 checksum from registry manifest
         |
         v
Verify CaMeL capability declarations match advertised
         |
         v
Load per tier
```

---

## 11. Dependency Resolution

Extensions can declare dependencies on other Extensions within the same layer.

### Resolution rules

1. **Within-layer topological sort.** On load, the runtime performs a topological sort of Extensions within each layer. If `report-writer` depends on `citation`, then `citation` hooks always fire before `report-writer` hooks.

2. **Cyclic dependency is a startup error.**

```
Error: Cyclic extension dependency detected: report-writer -> citation -> report-writer
       Remove the cycle or merge the extensions.
```

3. **Cross-layer dependencies are not supported.** Extensions in different layers already have a fixed execution order (L0 before L1 before L2, etc.). A Memory-layer Extension that needs Foundation-layer setup gets it automatically through layer ordering.

4. **Missing dependency behavior depends on optionality.** If `report-writer` depends on `citation` and `citation` fails to load:
   - If `report-writer` is `optional = true`: skip it with a warning.
   - If `report-writer` is `optional = false`: abort Agent startup.

---

## 12. Built-in Extensions

Roko ships with several built-in Extensions (Tier 5 -- Native Rust) that are always available.

| Extension | Layer | Hooks Used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `git` | L4 Action | `on_init`, `pre_action`, `post_action` | Git operations: commit, push, branch |
| `compiler` | L4 Action | `on_init`, `post_inference`, `post_action` | Compile checks after code changes |
| `test-runner` | L4 Action | `post_action` | Run tests after code changes |
| `safety` | L3 Cognition | `pre_inference`, `on_gate` | Safety checks on LLM requests |
| `cost-tracker` | L6 Meta | `on_cost_update`, `on_reflect` | Budget monitoring and alerts |
| `circuit-breaker` | L7 Recovery | `on_error`, `on_budget_exceeded` | Repeated failure detection |
| `neuro-store` | L2 Memory | `on_retrieve`, `on_store` | Knowledge store integration ([doc-11](11-MEMORY-AND-KNOWLEDGE.md)) |
| `web-search` | L1 Perception | `on_observe` | Web search during observation (Pulse medium) |
| `camel-monitor` | L6 Meta | `on_reflect`, `on_cost_update` | CaMeL IFC violation detection ([doc-17](17-SECURITY-MODEL.md)) |

### Domain profiles

Domain profiles provide default Extension sets. When an Agent declares `profile = "coding"`, it automatically loads the coding profile's Extensions unless overridden. See [doc-14](14-CONFIG-AND-AUTHORING.md) for the full domain profile specification -- profiles are complete cognitive postures, not just extension lists (see also [doc-07 SS12](07-AGENT-RUNTIME.md)).

---

## 13. Extension as Cell

In the unified vocabulary, an Extension is a Cell specialization. It conforms to the Cell trait with additional interception metadata.

```rust
impl Cell for MyExtension {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "my-extension" }
    fn version(&self) -> &Version { &self.version }
    fn description(&self) -> &str { "Intercepts action pipeline for safety" }
    fn input_schema(&self) -> &TypeSchema { &TypeSchema::Signal { kind: None } }
    fn output_schema(&self) -> &TypeSchema { &TypeSchema::Signal { kind: None } }
    fn capabilities(&self) -> &[Capability] { &self.required_capabilities }
    fn protocols(&self) -> &[Protocol] { &[] }

    async fn run(&self, _input: CellInput, _ctx: &CellContext) -> Result<CellOutput, CellError> {
        // Extensions are not invoked via run().
        // Their hooks are called by the runtime at the appropriate pipeline points.
        Err(CellError::LogicError {
            reason: "Extensions are invoked via hooks, not run()".into()
        })
    }
}
```

The `run()` method is not the primary execution path for Extensions. The runtime calls hooks directly. However, conforming to Cell allows Extensions to participate in the type system, capability model, and discovery mechanisms.

---

## 14. Extension Lifecycle

### Startup sequence

```
1. Load built-in Extensions (Tier 5)
2. Load local Extensions from .roko/extensions/ (Tiers 1-4)
3. Fetch registry Extensions (if referenced but not local)
4. Validate SHA-256 checksums (registry Extensions)
5. Validate CaMeL capability declarations against Space grants
6. Sort Extensions per layer:
   a. Topological sort by depends_on
   b. Stable sort by config order (within dependency groups)
7. For each Extension in layer order:
   a. Call on_init(&mut AgentContext)
   b. If on_init fails:
      - optional = true  --> log warning, remove from chain
      - optional = false  --> abort Agent startup
8. Agent pipeline begins
```

### Shutdown sequence

```
1. Agent pipeline stops (no new ticks)
2. For each Extension in REVERSE layer order (L7 -> L0):
   a. Call on_shutdown(&mut AgentContext)
   b. Log any errors (but continue shutdown)
3. Unload dynamic libraries / WASM modules
4. Release resources
```

Shutdown hooks fire in reverse order so that higher-layer Extensions (Recovery, Meta) clean up before lower-layer Extensions (Foundation) release resources they depend on.

---

## 15. Signal Flow Through Extensions

Extensions intercept data at specific pipeline points. Here is the flow for a typical Agent tick showing where Extension hooks fire and which medium each layer operates on:

```
                         Pulses In (Bus)
                             |
                             v
  L1: filter_input() --- [OBSERVE] --- L1: on_observe()     <- Pulse medium
                             |
                         graduation (if policy selects)
                             |
                             v
  L2: on_retrieve() ---- [RETRIEVE] --- L2: on_store()      <- Signal medium
                             |
                             v

## 16. TOML Configuration

### Agent-level Extension config

```toml
# roko.toml
[[agents]]
name = "coder-1"
profile = "coding"
extensions = [
  { name = "custom-linter", optional = true },
  { name = "report-writer", optional = true, config = { format = "markdown", max_length = 5000 } },
]
disable_extensions = ["test-runner"]    # disable a profile default
```

### Extension-level config

```toml
[extensions.custom-linter]
rules_path = ".roko/lint-rules.yaml"
severity = "warning"
timeout_ms = 10000
```

The runtime passes this config to the Extension's `on_init` hook via `AgentContext.config`.

## 17. Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| EX-1 | Extension trait compiles with all 22 hooks and default no-op implementations | `cargo check` |
| EX-2 | `FilterDecision::Drop` silently discards Pulse (logged at DEBUG) | Unit test |
| EX-3 | `FilterDecision::Transform` replaces Pulse content, preserves CaMeL tags | Unit test |
| EX-4 | `ActionDecision::Block` halts action but Agent continues | Integration test |
| EX-5 | `ToolDecision::Substitute` transparently replaces tool call, tags propagated | Unit test |
| EX-6 | `RecoveryAction::Retry` retries the failed operation | Integration test |
| EX-7 | `BudgetAction::Sleepwalk` restricts Agent to observe+reflect | Integration test |
| EX-8 | Hook timeout at 5 seconds triggers warning, next Extension continues | Integration test |
| EX-9 | Missing optional Extension logs warning, Agent starts normally | Integration test |
| EX-10 | Missing required Extension aborts Agent startup with clear error | Integration test |
| EX-11 | Cyclic dependency detected at startup with cycle description | Unit test |
| EX-12 | Extensions sorted: by layer, then by dependency, then by config order | Unit test |
| EX-13 | Built-in Extensions always load first | Integration test |
| EX-14 | Registry fetch verifies SHA-256 checksum | Integration test |
| EX-15 | Shutdown hooks fire in reverse layer order | Integration test |
| EX-16 | Extension hook errors do not crash the Agent | Integration test |
| EX-17 | 5 consecutive hook failures disable the Extension | Integration test |
| EX-18 | Decision defaults apply when hook errors | Integration test |
| EX-19 | CaMeL tags propagate through Transform decisions | Unit test |
| EX-20 | CaMeL tags cannot be elevated through Extensions | Unit test |
| EX-21 | L1 and L5 hooks receive Pulses, not Signals | Integration test |
| EX-22 | CamelTag provenance chain intact after 3+ Extension hops | Unit test |
| EX-23 | 5-tier SPI: WASM Extension loads and runs sandboxed | Integration test |

## 18. Crate Mapping

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `roko-core` | Extension trait definition, ExtensionLayer enum, decision enums, CaMeL tag types |
| `roko-agent` | Extension loading, dependency resolution, hook dispatch, fault isolation, CaMeL tag propagation |
| `roko-std` | Built-in Extension implementations (git, compiler, test-runner, camel-monitor, etc.) |
| `roko-cli` | Extension configuration in roko.toml, profile defaults |
| `roko-serve` | Extension status endpoints (`GET /api/extensions`) |
| `roko-gate` | CaMeL IFC verification (see [doc-17](17-SECURITY-MODEL.md)) |
