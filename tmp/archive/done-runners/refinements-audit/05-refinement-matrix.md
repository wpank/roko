# Refinement Matrix

Legend:
- `keep`
- `narrow`
- `defer`
- `rewrite`

| Ref | Title | Verdict | Audit note |
|---|---|---|---|
| REF01 | critique one noun | `keep` | The diagnosis is real: transport is under-modeled and the kernel story is too storage-centric. |
| REF02 | Engram vs Pulse | `keep` | `Pulse` is a good transport noun if used to clarify the redesign rather than force a total renaming campaign. |
| REF03 | Bus as first class | `keep` | This is the strongest foundational follow-up: unify and formalize transport. |
| REF04 | operators generalized | `narrow` | Good local idea, bad universal law. Medium polymorphism should be proven operator by operator. |
| REF05 | loop retold | `keep` | Useful as a reference architecture for the redesign, but should guide migration rather than dictate every interface immediately. |
| REF06 | refactoring plan | `keep` | A phased migration plan is appropriate; keep it honest and code-first. |
| REF07 | naming | `narrow` | Good cleanup instinct, but not every proposed term should become top-level canon immediately. |
| REF08 | code sketches | `narrow` | Helpful as exploratory sketches; should not be confused with settled API design. |
| REF09 | phase-2 implications | `narrow` | Good future map, but it should stay downstream of core runtime wins instead of shaping the first redesign pass. |
| REF10 | self-learning loops | `keep` | Strong direction if centered on calibration, contradiction, and adaptation rather than runtime-wide active-inference doctrine. |
| REF11 | HDC substrate | `narrow` | Keep HDC for retrieval/clustering; defer broader semantic-consensus rhetoric. |
| REF12 | knowledge demurrage | `defer` | Interesting hypothesis, but too early to present as the governing memory model. |
| REF13 | c-factor | `defer` | Worth exploring as coordination health, not yet worthy of strong canonical treatment. |
| REF14 | worldview validation | `narrow` | Keep typed heuristics and contradiction tracking; defer full worldview/dissonance stack. |
| REF15 | exponential scaling | `defer` | Too much product-theory confidence for the current maturity level. |
| REF16 | research-to-runtime | `narrow` | Claim registry and provenance-backed defaults are promising; the full paper economy is premature. |
| REF17 | plugin extension architecture | `keep` | Tiered extensibility is the right platform direction if it stays local-first and resists premature ecosystem ambition. |
| REF18 | competitive moat | `defer` | Too much architecture-theater and future-ecosystem assumption. |
| REF19 | net-new innovations | `rewrite` | The catalog format oversells speculative pieces; convert to research hypotheses or remove. |
| REF20 | modularity composability | `keep` | Crate-boundary cleanup and clearer seams are real needs. |
| REF21 | from-scratch redesigns | `narrow` | Useful as a pressure test and cleanup lens, but dangerous as the default implementation mindset. |
| REF22 | developer UX rust | `keep` | Strong redesign target if the SDK is kept crisp and optimized for time-to-first-agent rather than feature taxonomy. |
| REF23 | user UX running agents | `keep` | Strong target-state direction if parity follows a real shared session model instead of surface symmetry for its own sake. |
| REF24 | deployment UX | `keep` | Strong operator-centered direction; needs stricter sequencing and fewer assumptions bundled into the first wave. |
| REF25 | domain-specific agents | `keep` | Domain profiles are a strong packaging abstraction as long as bundles stay ahead of universal type formalism. |
| REF26 | StateHub rearchitecture | `keep` | One of the best proposals. Evolve the existing dashboard hub into real projections. |
| REF27 | realtime event surface | `keep` | Unification is the right target, but the contract should stay small: events, replay, filters, subscriptions. |
| REF28 | CLI parity familiar workflows | `keep` | Familiar-first is right if parity is earned from shared workflow semantics rather than copied command names. |
| REF29 | web UI architecture | `keep` | A web surface is a good redesign goal if it starts as an ops console and grows from projection contracts. |
| REF30 | rich UX primitives | `narrow` | Some primitives are valuable, but only when supported by real shared state and telemetry contracts. |
| REF31 | synergy integration map | `defer` | Fine as internal coherence tooling; too grand as canonical architecture backmatter. |
| REF32 | safety sandbox provenance | `keep` | Strong direction if safety remains a compact enforceable spine rather than an all-at-once governance superstructure. |
| REF33 | observability telemetry | `keep` | Strong direction if the signal set stays operator-useful and avoids speculative overmodeling. |
| REF34 | glossary | `rewrite` | Keep one glossary, but split current canon from target-state proposals. |
| REF35 | consolidated roadmap | `rewrite` | Keep sequencing discipline, but narrow the number of simultaneous deep bets and remove unearned quarter-level certainty. |

## Practical consequence

The refinement set should not be treated as a monolithic "land it all" bundle.
The right next pass is:

1. Preserve the `keep` items.
2. Rewrite the `narrow` items around smaller scope and less doctrinal force.
3. Move the `defer` items into explicit future-work or research-hypothesis sections.
4. Rebuild the `rewrite` items so they stop acting as authority multipliers for
   architecture that is still too speculative or too overloaded.
