## Shared Context Pack

### 00-REFINEMENTS-RULES

# Refinements Runner — Common Rules (read first)

You are running as an unattended Codex batch from `tmp/refinements-runner`.
Your job: propagate one specific refinement proposal (in `tmp/refinements/`)
into the canonical docs tree under `docs/` so the docs reflect the new
framing.

## Core rules

1. **No prior chat.** This prompt pack must be self-sufficient.
2. **Docs-only.** You may only edit files under `docs/`. Every other path —
   including `crates/**`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tmp/**`, `src/**` — is
   **out of scope**. The verify `scope_gate` fails the batch if any file
   outside `docs/` is touched.
3. **Repository reality only.** Work from files that exist in the worktree.
   Verify current tree with `rg --files` / `rg -n` rather than guessing.
4. **Preserve authority.** The refinement file itself (injected into this
   prompt) is the canonical source. Do not edit it. The docs you touch
   *reflect* it; they do not replace it.
5. **Aggressive edit posture authorised.** You may do full section rewrites
   or full-file rewrites when a doc is deeply misaligned with the
   refinement's framing. Smaller incremental edits are preferred when they
   suffice.
6. **Retired terms must not appear.** Verify-step `terminology_check` will
   fail the batch if retired terms (`Grimoire`, `Styx`, `Clade`, `Mori`,
   `Bardo`, `Golem`, mortal/death/reincarnation framing, "Signal = Engram"
   disclaimers, etc.) appear in lines you introduce — *except* when the
   line explicitly frames them as "retired / deprecated / historical /
   legacy / formerly / renamed / see also / old name". Use that phrasing
   when a retirement table is appropriate.
7. **Cross-link to refinements.** Docs that change should include a
   `see tmp/refinements/NN-slug.md` pointer for readers who want the full
   proposal. Use the exact refinement filename (e.g.
   `tmp/refinements/02-engram-vs-pulse.md`).
8. **Cross-link to glossary.** Docs introducing new terminology should
   point at `docs/00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md` (or wherever
   the glossary has landed).
9. **Subagents authorised.** Every batch includes a "Delegation
   Requirement" section. Use explorers and workers in parallel when the
   target file set is large.
10. **No destructive git.** Never force-push, reset, `rm -rf`. The runner
    handles branch/worktree lifecycle.

## Batch completion bar

A batch is only complete when:

- At least one file under `docs/` is changed (the diff gate fails empty
  batches).
- The batch's required new vocabulary appears in the changed set where
  applicable (per `batch_required_terms` in `lib/common.sh`).
- No retired terms leak into prose outside explicitly retired contexts.
- No file outside `docs/` is touched.
- The new content in each doc is substantive (not "TODO: rewrite later").
- Index docs (`docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/**/INDEX.md`) are updated when new
  chapters are added.

## Failure behaviour

If the batch's scope turns out too broad for the timeout:

- Prioritise the canonical file for this refinement (see batch target
  list) first, then expand outward.
- Land the highest-dependency work before the low-dependency polish.
- Leave a precise note in the final message listing what remains — the
  runner logs it for the next attempt.
- Do not leave half-written sections. If you start rewriting a section,
  finish it.

## Delegation etiquette

When spawning subagents:

- Give each worker a **disjoint** write scope (different files).
- Tell each worker they are **not alone** in the codebase.
- Pass the same context pack (these 6 files) + the same refinement
  source to every subagent.
- Reassemble their work; do not merge half-complete outputs.

## What "aggressive edit posture" means

For a deeply misaligned doc:

- You may replace the entire body with a new version that aligns to the
  refinement.
- Preserve the doc's stable identity: title, filename, anchor IDs used
  elsewhere.
- When you rewrite, cite the refinement source in the opening so readers
  understand the change is intentional and load-bearing.

For a mostly-aligned doc:

- Edit incrementally. Insert new sections where they fit; update stale
  claims; remove stale disclaimers; add cross-references.

Either way: don't produce a half-consistent doc. If the rewrite would
contradict other sections you are not updating in this batch, finish the
other sections too.

## What NOT to do

- Do not touch `tmp/refinements/**` — that's the source. Read-only.
- Do not create new `.md` files outside `docs/`.
- Do not delete large swaths of content without replacing it — the doc
  stays load-bearing after your edit.
- Do not reference files that do not yet exist without an explicit "(to
  be added in batch REFxx)" marker.
- Do not add content that contradicts other refinements that have
  already landed. If you find a contradiction, document it in the final
  message and proceed with the simplest consistent edit.

## Context paths

Always read these files before editing:

1. `tmp/refinements-runner/context-pack/00-REFINEMENTS-RULES.md` (this)
2. `tmp/refinements-runner/context-pack/01-TWO-FABRIC-PRIMER.md`
3. `tmp/refinements-runner/context-pack/02-TERMINOLOGY-TABLE.md`
4. `tmp/refinements-runner/context-pack/03-DOCS-TREE-MAP.md`
5. `tmp/refinements-runner/context-pack/04-SYNERGY-SUMMARY.md`
6. `tmp/refinements-runner/context-pack/05-REFINEMENTS-INDEX.md`

And the canonical refinement file for this batch (injected below under
"Canonical refinement source").

### 01-TWO-FABRIC-PRIMER

# The Two-Fabric Framing — Primer

Every batch needs this vocabulary. It is the shared mental model that
the 35 refinements propagate into `docs/`.

## The one-liner

> Roko's kernel is two mediums (**Engram** — durable, content-addressed,
> decayed; **Pulse** — ephemeral, topic-addressed, sequenced) moving
> through two fabrics (**Substrate** — storage; **Bus** — transport),
> acted on by six operators (**Scorer**, **Gate**, **Router**,
> **Composer**, **Policy**, plus the fabric traits). Layers enforce a
> downward-only dependency rule. Three cognitive speeds (Gamma, Theta,
> Delta) run the loop; three cross-cuts (Neuro, Daimon, Dreams) inject
> across layers.

## Canonical term definitions

**Engram** — Durable medium. Content-addressed by BLAKE3 over
`(kind, body, author, tags)`. Has `lineage: Vec<ContentHash>`,
`decay` / `balance`, `score` (7 axes), `provenance`, optional
`attestation`, and (post-refinement) an HDC `fingerprint`. Lives in a
Substrate.

**Pulse** — Ephemeral medium (new). Typed, topic-addressed,
sequence-numbered, ring-buffered message on a Bus. Not content-
addressed; not persisted by default. May *graduate* to an Engram when
its lineage matters.

**Substrate** — Storage fabric (kernel trait). Backends: Memory, File,
HDC, Chain. Persists Engrams. Retrieval by filter or (new)
HDC similarity.

**Bus** — Transport fabric (promoted to kernel trait). Backends:
BroadcastBus (in-process), MultiBus, NatsBus / KafkaBus
(multi-process, Phase 2+), ChainBus (on-chain events, Phase 2+).
Publishes and delivers Pulses by Topic.

**Topic** — Routing handle for Pulses. Dot-separated lowercase
strings (`gate.verdict.emitted`, `agent.msg.chunk`, `prediction.error`).

**Datum** — `enum Datum<'a> { Engram(&'a Engram), Pulse(&'a Pulse) }`
used by polymorphic operators (Scorer, Composer, Router).

**Six operators** — `Scorer`, `Gate`, `Router`, `Composer`, `Policy`,
plus the fabric traits `Substrate` and `Bus` (which act as storage
and transport operators themselves).

## The loop (revised)

The universal cognitive loop becomes 7 steps, with co-equal PERSIST
and BROADCAST:

```
1. SENSE      — Substrate.query | Bus.subscribe | external I/O
2. ASSESS     — Scorer + Router pick what to do
3. COMPOSE    — Composer assembles a prompt Engram under a budget
4. ACT        — execute (LLM | tool | chain); produces Pulses + final Engram
5. VERIFY     — Gate pipeline + optional stream-gates; emits Verdict Engram
6. PERSIST    — Substrate.put (Engrams)
   BROADCAST  — Bus.publish (Pulses, in parallel)
7. REACT      — Policies react, emit new Pulses + Engrams
```

Cross-cuts are NOT loop steps. Neuro, Daimon, and Dreams inject into
operators at specific steps, not into the loop sequence.

## The five layers

L0 Runtime (Substrate, Bus, process supervisor, cancellation, clock)
L1 Framework (tools, routing, safety)
L2 Scaffold (context, composition)
L3 Harness (gates, monitoring)
L4 Orchestration (plan DAG, scheduling)

Strictly downward dependencies. The Bus (promoted) joins Substrate at
L0.

## Three speeds

Gamma (~5-15 s) — turn-level. Token streams, quick gates, live
context.

Theta (~75 s) — plan-level. Full gate pipeline, episode consolidation,
routing learning.

Delta (hours) — background. Dreams consolidation, tier progression,
meta-template optimization.

Same seven-step loop at all three speeds; only scope, budget, and
persistence cadence change.

## Three cross-cuts

**Neuro** — Durable knowledge store, distillation, tier progression.
Formerly Grimoire. Inject into Substrate reads (step 1) and Composer
(step 3).

**Daimon** — PAD-vector affect. Formerly loop "step 9 META-COGNIZE."
Inject into Scorer bias (step 2) and Action gate (step 4).

**Dreams** — Offline consolidation loop at Delta speed. Inject
consolidated knowledge back into Substrate for the next cycle.

## Naming — quick reference

| Term | Use | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Engram | the durable record | Signal (retired in code 877:5) |
| Pulse | the ephemeral message | Event, Envelope, Message, Signal |
| Bus | the transport trait | EventBus<E> as a trait name |
| Substrate | the storage trait | (unchanged) |
| Topic | routing handle | Channel, Subject |
| Datum | polymorphic reference | `&Any`, variant enums |
| Neuro | cross-cut | Grimoire |
| Mesh | agent-network layer | Styx |
| Fleet | agent roster | Clade |
| Roko | the project | Bardo, Golem, Mori |

Never use "mortal", "death", "reincarnation" framing. Retired.

### 02-TERMINOLOGY-TABLE

# Terminology Table (retired → current)

This table is the single source of truth for what terminology must
appear / not appear in updated docs. The verify step (`terminology_check`
in `lib/verify.sh`) greps for the "retired" column and fails when any
match lands outside a line that also signals "retired", "deprecated",
"historical", "formerly", "legacy", "old name", "renamed", or
"see also".

## Retired → use instead

| Retired term | Use instead | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Signal` (as the durable record) | `Engram` | Rename landed in code (877 Engram vs 5 Signal). Docs should say Engram. |
| `Signal is the same as Engram` | (delete disclaimer) | The equivalence disclaimer is stale. Remove. |
| `EventBus<E>` (as trait name) | `Bus` + `Pulse` | The generic struct stays as `BroadcastBus` implementation detail. |
| `Envelope<E>` (as user-facing type) | `Pulse` | Envelope name retained only as internal impl detail. |
| `Event` (as type name) | `Pulse` | Collides with tokio/winit. Use Pulse. |
| `Message` (as Roko type name) | `Pulse` (wire) / `ChatMessage` (LLM) | Overloaded term. |
| `Grimoire` | `Neuro` | Cross-cut; durable knowledge store. |
| `Styx` | `Mesh` + `Korai` | Split into mesh (network) + Korai (chain). |
| `Clade` | `Fleet` | Agent roster. |
| `Bardo` | `Roko` | Project name. |
| `Golem` | `Agent` | Agent session/process. |
| `Mori` | `Roko` | Project name. |
| `mortal` / `death as <x>` / `reincarnation` | (remove framing) | Retired thematic framing. |

## Allowed contexts for retired terms

Lines that explicitly frame the retirement are allowed:

- "formerly Grimoire"
- "renamed from Signal"
- "historical: Styx"
- "see also: the retired term `Event`"
- "deprecated: `EventBus<E>` — use the `Bus` trait"
- "old name: Bardo (pre-2026)"
- A retirement table column labelled "retired" or "legacy"

The verify step allows these by matching a loose set of context markers
in the same line (case-insensitive): `retired`, `deprecated`,
`historical`, `formerly`, `legacy`, `old name`, `see also`, `renamed`.

## New term quick reference (where they should appear)

| New term | Must appear after batch | Home refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `Pulse` | REF02, REF07 | 02-engram-vs-pulse.md |
| `Bus` (as kernel trait) | REF03 | 03-bus-as-first-class.md |
| `Topic` | REF03, REF07 | 03-bus-as-first-class.md |
| `TopicFilter` | REF03, REF07 | 03-bus-as-first-class.md |
| `Datum` | REF04 | 04-operators-generalized.md |

| `heuristic` (as first-class kind) | REF14 | 14-worldview-validation.md |
| `c-factor` | REF13 | 13-collective-intelligence-c-factor.md |
| `HDC fingerprint` | REF11 | 11-hyperdimensional-substrate.md |
| `replication ledger` | REF16 | 16-research-to-runtime.md |
| `StateHub projection` | REF26 | 26-statehub-rearchitecture.md |
| `TypedContext` | REF25 | 25-domain-specific-agents.md |
| `Custody` (chain-of-custody) | REF32 | 32-safety-sandbox-provenance.md |
| `synergy matrix` | REF31 | 31-synergy-integration-map.md |

## Cross-references between docs

Every refinement propagation should include a trailing "See also" or
inline cross-reference to the refinement file:

- `see [02-engram-vs-pulse](../../tmp/refinements/02-engram-vs-pulse.md)`
- or `see tmp/refinements/02-engram-vs-pulse.md §3` for section-specific
  references.

Use the project's existing link conventions where a doc subfolder has
them. When in doubt, absolute repo-relative paths are always correct.

### 03-DOCS-TREE-MAP

# docs/ Tree Map

The `docs/` directory has 23 subdirectories and ~405 Markdown files.
This map tells you where each subsystem lives so you can find the right
file to edit for a given refinement.

## Top-level files

- `docs/INDEX.md` — master index. Linked from the repo root.
- `docs/VISION-RUN-ANYWHERE.md` — deployment vision.

## Sub-chapters (organised by architecture topic number)

## docs/00-architecture/ (the big one)

This folder has the canonical numbered architecture chapter. When a
refinement affects "the architecture story," these are usually the files
to update:

- `00-vision-and-thesis.md`
- `01-naming-and-glossary.md` — every naming-related refinement touches this
- `02-engram-data-type.md` — REF02
- `03-score-7-axis-appraisal.md` — mostly stable
- `04-decay-variants.md` — REF12 (supersedes decay with demurrage)
- `05-provenance-and-attestation.md` — REF32
- `06-synapse-traits.md` — REF01, REF04
- `07-substrate-trait.md` — REF03 (split into 07a + 07b)
- `08-scorer-gate-router-composer-policy.md` — REF04
- `09-universal-cognitive-loop.md` — REF05 (rewrite to 7 steps)
- `10-three-cognitive-speeds.md` — mostly stable
- `11-dual-process-and-active-inference.md` — REF10
- `12-five-layer-taxonomy.md` — REF03, REF20
- `13-cognitive-cross-cuts.md` — REF05 (cross-cuts inject into ops)
- `14-c-factor-collective-intelligence.md` — REF13
- `15-crate-map.md` — REF20
- `16-autocatalytic-and-cybernetics.md` — REF10, REF15
- `17-design-principles-and-frontier-summary.md` — REF18, REF19
- `18-decay-tier-matrix.md` — REF12
- `19-compositional-kinds.md` — REF02, REF04
- `20-configuration-schema.md` — REF12 (demurrage rates), REF14
- `21-performance-numerical-stability.md` — REF33
- `22-error-handling-recovery.md` — mostly stable
- `23-architectural-analysis-improvements.md` — REF01, REF04, REF20, REF21
- `24-cross-section-integration-map.md` — REF03, REF09, REF26, REF31
- `25-attention-as-currency.md` — REF12
- `26-cognitive-immune-system.md` — REF32
- `27-temporal-knowledge-topology.md` — REF11
- `28-emergent-goal-structures.md` — mostly stable
- `29-cognitive-energy-model.md` — REF15
- `30-cross-pollination-innovations.md` — REF15, REF18, REF19
- `31-implementation-readiness-audit.md` — REF06, REF21, REF35
- `32-comprehensive-test-strategy.md` — REF33
- `INDEX.md` — most refinements

## INDEX conventions

Every subdir has an `INDEX.md`. When you add a new chapter or change a
chapter's scope, update the relevant INDEX.md. The top-level
`docs/INDEX.md` aggregates; update it when the change is cross-chapter.

## When you can't find the right home for new content

If a refinement introduces a new concept (e.g. `heuristic` as a
first-class memory kind in REF14), either:

1. Add it to an existing file where it naturally fits (preferred for
   small additions), OR
2. Add a new file in the right subdirectory with a natural number that
   doesn't collide. Look at the existing numbering to pick the next
   stable slot.

Do NOT add files in `docs/00-architecture/` with numbers already in use.

## What's NOT in docs/ (and why to leave it alone)

- `crates/**` — source code. Never touch.
- `README.md` (repo root) — out of scope for this runner.
- `CLAUDE.md` — out of scope.
- `tmp/refinements/**` — read-only source.
- `tmp/ux-followup/**`, `tmp/MASTER-PLAN.md` — out of scope.

If you want to cross-link from a doc you're editing to e.g. a crate or
CLAUDE.md, use a relative repo path like `../../crates/roko-core/` —
that's a reference, not an edit.

### 04-SYNERGY-SUMMARY

# Synergy Summary

Condensed from `tmp/refinements/31-synergy-integration-map.md`. Use this
when a batch needs to know how the primitive it's propagating interacts
with the others.

## Ten load-bearing primitives

1. **Engram** (durable medium) — home: REF02
2. **Pulse** (ephemeral medium) — home: REF02
3. **Bus** (transport fabric) — home: REF03
4. **Substrate** (storage fabric) — home: REF03
5. **HDC fingerprint** — home: REF11
6. **Demurrage** (attention economy) — home: REF12
7. **Heuristics + falsifiers** — home: REF14
8. **c-factor** (collective intelligence) — home: REF13
9. **Replication ledger** — home: REF16
10. **Plugin SPI + domain profiles** — homes: REF17, REF25

## Named synergies (ten concrete interactions)

When propagating any one of these primitives into docs, cross-link to
the ones it composes with:

- **Demurrage × HDC → self-trimming semantic memory.** Substrate +
  HDC + Demurrage combined produce memory that self-prunes toward
  unique-and-used. Cite in REF11, REF12.
- **Heuristic × Pulse × Bus → continuous calibration.** Falsifier
  Pulses close the loop. Cite in REF14.
- **c-factor × Bus × HDC → diversity-aware routing.** Cite in REF13.
- **Replication ledger × Heuristics × Paper → living research.** Cite
  in REF14, REF16.
- **Plugin SPI × Substrate × Bus → ecosystem growth.** Cite in REF17.
- **c-factor × Heuristics → peer-model learning.** Cite in REF13, REF14.
- **Dreams × Substrate × Pulse → retroactive insight.** Cite in REF09.
- **Demurrage × Heuristic × Calibration → graceful relearning.** Cite
  in REF12, REF14.
- **HDC × Consensus × Bus → substantive agreement.** Cite in REF11,
  REF13.
- **TypedContext × Domain × Gate → auditable domain safety.** Cite in
  REF25, REF32.

## The moat claim (short form)

Feature-level competition copies any single primitive in weeks. The
*composition* of all 10 primitives into one coherent system is a
multi-year project. Refinement docs in `docs/20-technical-analysis/`
should include this framing.

## The loop across the primitives

The seven-step loop (SENSE, ASSESS, COMPOSE, ACT, VERIFY, PERSIST,
BROADCAST, REACT) uses every primitive:

- SENSE — Substrate (query) + Bus (subscribe) + external I/O.
- ASSESS — Scorer (weights via HDC/demurrage/heuristic calibration).
- COMPOSE — Composer (picks from HDC-similar Engrams, injects heuristics,
  TypedContext shapes prompt).
- ACT — produces Pulses (agent stream, tool calls).
- VERIFY — Gate pipeline; gate-verdict Pulses feed heuristic calibration.
- PERSIST — Substrate put, demurrage balance assigned; HDC fingerprint
  computed; Custody record written for auditable actions.
- BROADCAST — Bus publish, StateHub projections fold deltas.
- REACT — Policy decides; c-factor observers log; replication ledger
  watchdog checks claim falsifiers.

Every step references multiple primitives. Cross-reference accordingly
when writing prose for any refinement.

### 05-REFINEMENTS-INDEX

# Refinements Index — 35 Proposals

One-sentence summary of every refinement in `tmp/refinements/`. Use
this when a batch needs to know what a neighboring refinement is about
without reading its full source.

## Foundation (01–09)

- `01-critique-one-noun.md` — Diagnosis: "one noun, six verbs" framing
  conflates two data shapes, hides the event bus, stretches trait
  signatures.
- `02-engram-vs-pulse.md` — Introduce Pulse (ephemeral) as Engram's
  sibling; define graduation law.
- `03-bus-as-first-class.md` — Promote Bus to a kernel trait at L0
  alongside Substrate.
- `04-operators-generalized.md` — Generalize the six operators over a
  `Datum` enum that is either Engram or Pulse.
- `05-loop-retold.md` — Universal loop collapses from 9 to 7 steps;
  PERSIST and BROADCAST become co-equal; cross-cuts aren't steps.
- `06-refactoring-plan.md` — Three-phase refactor (docs → kernel →
  subsystem migration); 6–7 weeks total.
- `07-naming.md` — Name the new ephemeral type `Pulse` (not `Event`,
  not `Signal`). Bus, Topic, TopicFilter, Datum.
- `08-code-sketches.md` — Concrete Rust: Pulse type, Bus trait, Datum
  enum, graduation, conductor port.
- `09-phase-2-implications.md` — Chain, Dreams, Mesh, Coordination
  (stigmergy), Heartbeat, HTTP control plane all become Bus consumers.

## Learning, intelligence, moat (10–21)

- `10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops.md` — Every operator becomes a
  predictor; active inference literal via predict/outcome Pulses.
- `11-hyperdimensional-substrate.md` — 10,240-bit HDC fingerprint on
  every Engram; similarity/consensus/analogy as O(1) vector ops.
- `12-knowledge-demurrage.md` — Economic memory: balance, holding
  cost, reinforcement-by-kind; self-trimming playbooks.
- `13-collective-intelligence-c-factor.md` — Woolley's c-factor
  measured continuously from Bus statistics; Policy optimizes it.
- `14-worldview-validation.md` — Heuristics with explicit falsifiers;
  worldviews as co-citation clusters; lived-experience calibration.
- `15-exponential-scaling.md` — Seven compounding loops; "every week
  your Roko gets better on your codebase."
- `16-research-to-runtime.md` — Papers as Engrams, Claims as testable
  hypotheses, Replication Ledger — living research.
- `17-plugin-extension-architecture.md` — Five-tier SPI (prompts,
  profiles, manifests, native, WASM) with matched sandboxes.
- `18-competitive-moat.md` — Five structural components: coherence,
  heuristic commons, ecosystem, replication ledger, Rust correctness.
- `19-net-new-innovations.md` — Flat catalog of primitives with no
  known prior art.
- `20-modularity-composability.md` — Proposed dep graph; three new
  kernel crates (roko-bus, roko-hdc, roko-spi).
- `21-from-scratch-redesigns.md` — Five rewrite candidates with cost/
  unlock analysis and 2-month sequencing.

## UX (22–30)

- `22-developer-ux-rust.md` — Four-layer Rust SDK (one-liner / builder /
  trait / runtime) for Rust devs building agents.
- `23-user-ux-running-agents.md` — One verb-set, four surfaces (CLI /
  TUI / Chat / Web); interactive first-run.
- `24-deployment-ux.md` — Five deployment shapes (laptop /
  single-server / container / clustered / edge).
- `25-domain-specific-agents.md` — Six domain profiles (coding,
  research, blockchain, data, ops, writing) + TypedContext + Custody.
- `26-statehub-rearchitecture.md` — Promote StateHub from TUI helper
  to kernel projection layer; typed, filterable, multi-consumer.
- `27-realtime-event-surface.md` — WebSocket / SSE / gRPC with a
  single wire protocol; first-party clients.
- `28-cli-parity-familiar-workflows.md` — Claude Code / Aider muscle
  memory; slash commands, diff-first, per-hunk control, transcripts.
- `29-web-ui-architecture.md` — Five-page first-party web UI on
  SvelteKit + StateHub.
- `30-rich-ux-primitives.md` — Ten UX primitives: reasoning streams,
  tool banners, heuristic footnotes, replay scrubber, uncertainty bars.

## Integrators (31–35)

- `31-synergy-integration-map.md` — 10×10 matrix showing how the
  primitives reinforce each other. The moat is the interaction density.
- `32-safety-sandbox-provenance.md` — Safety spine: role auth, tier
  sandboxes, custody, taint, attestation, multi-tenancy.
- `33-observability-telemetry.md` — Logs / metrics / traces / events /
  replay / cost; Roko-specific metrics like `roko.c_factor`.
- `34-glossary.md` — A–Z vocabulary of every new and retired term.
- `35-consolidated-roadmap.md` — Dependency graph and Q1–Q4 sequencing
  across all refinements.

## Reading shortcut

If a batch's refinement depends on earlier ones, the batch's `deps` in
`lib/common.sh` is non-empty. The runner's DAG ensures they've landed
before. When your prompt talks about Pulse (REF02) as assumed
vocabulary, REF02 is already done in the current worktree.

## Delegation Requirement

You are authorized to use subagents. Prefer multiple parallel agents when
the target docs set is large.

Required delegation behavior:

- Form a plan first — for each candidate `docs/` file listed in the batch,
  decide (a) does it need changes, (b) how big, (c) is it self-contained.
- For large independent files, spawn a worker per file with a disjoint
  write scope.
- Every subagent gets the same context pack and the same refinement source.
- Do not wait idly for subagents if you can progress locally.
- If subagents are unavailable in this environment, continue locally.

Suggested parallel split for batch `REF07`:

- worker: rewrite `docs/00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md` per the
  canonical vocabulary: Pulse, Bus, Topic, TopicFilter, Datum, PulseSource,
  Engram (already there), with a retired-terms table.
- worker: update `docs/00-architecture/INDEX.md` abstract with the
  "two mediums, two fabrics, six operators" one-liner.

## Canonical refinement source

This is the verbatim refinement proposal that this batch must propagate
into `docs/`. Treat it as the authoritative source. Do not edit this
file; only edit docs under `docs/`.

# Naming Decisions

> **TL;DR**: Keep `Engram` for the durable record. For the ephemeral
> message use **`Pulse`**. Reclaim the name `Signal` only if we really
> want to — it's on the table but has downsides. Don't use `Event` alone
> (too generic). The transport trait is `Bus`. The topic identifier is
> `Topic`.

## 1. What we know for sure

**`Engram` stays.** The rename Signal → Engram is already done in code
(877 occurrences vs. 5 for Signal). The name has neuroscience
lineage (Semon 1904, Lashley, Tonegawa), and `docs/00-architecture/02-engram-data-type.md`
has a solid justification paragraph for it. Don't touch this.

**`Bus` is the transport trait.** Short, standard in systems-programming
vocabulary, mirrors `Substrate`'s shape (both are storage/transport
fabrics). Not controversial.

**`Topic` is the routing handle.** Matches pub/sub convention across
NATS, Kafka, MQTT, AMQP. Not controversial.

The only real decision is what to call the medium that flows on the
Bus.

## 2. The contenders

### 2.1 `Pulse` — recommended

**Pro**:
- Neuro-coherent with Engram. An engram is a persistent memory trace;
  a pulse is the instantaneous signal that deposits it. The cognitive
  metaphor extends naturally.
- Not currently used anywhere in the Roko codebase (grep
  `\bpulse\b` in `crates/` returns clippy lints for unrelated code,
  nothing load-bearing).
- Communicates ephemerality. "Pulse" implies something that fires
  and passes. "Event" and "Signal" don't.
- Short (5 letters). Good for common type name.
- No namespace collision with popular Rust crates.

**Con**:
- Mildly unusual for an event/message type. Developers coming from
  other pub/sub systems will wonder if it's something special.
- The word has prior art in distributed systems (Apache Pulsar,
  PulseAudio, HeartbeatPulse) but none of those are Rust-idiomatic
  collisions.

**Verdict**: Best choice. Neurocognitive coherence wins; the
novelty is actually an asset for a framework that wants a
distinctive vocabulary.

### 2.2 `Signal` (reclaiming)

**Pro**:
- The name is literally free: the rename Signal → Engram moved the
  old type out. Reclaiming `Signal` for the transient event matches
  the original *engineering* meaning of the word (Shannon
  information, POSIX signals, electrical signals).
- No new word to learn.

**Con**:
- **This is the problem.** Roko's docs and commit history still carry
  heavy "Signal = Engram" content. Reclaiming `Signal` for a
  different meaning in the same codebase will confuse readers for
  years. Every old doc that says "Signal" will now be wrong in a
  subtly different way.
- The doc 23 audit and the "Signal ↔ Engram" naming glossary at
  `docs/00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md` explicitly call
  the two concepts "the same" — reclaiming Signal contradicts that
  statement without erasing it from history.
- Grep will become painful. `rg Signal` will return both old legacy
  references and new transient-event references indistinguishably.

**Verdict**: Don't. The naming-cleanup cost exceeds the benefit.

### 2.3 `Event`

**Pro**:
- Universally understood. Every pub/sub system in the world has
  `Event`.
- Easy to onboard external developers.

**Con**:
- Collides with tokio, winit, and every other Rust crate that has
  an Event type. Imports become noisy.
- Generic — doesn't carry Roko-specific meaning. The framework's
  distinctive vocabulary gets diluted.
- Doesn't pair as well with `Engram` (Engram is specific to Roko;
  Event is specific to nothing).

**Verdict**: Workable fallback if `Pulse` is vetoed, but weaker.

### 2.4 `Message`

**Pro**: Clear, neutral.
**Con**: Also highly colliding. Same problems as `Event`, with the
added issue that `Message` in LLM contexts already means a chat
message.
**Verdict**: No.

### 2.5 `Envelope`

**Pro**: Matches the existing `Envelope<E>` name in `roko-runtime`.
**Con**: An Envelope *wraps* a payload. It's the container, not the
thing. If we kept this name, we'd still need a name for the payload.
**Verdict**: Keep `Envelope` as an internal implementation detail if
desired, but don't use it as the user-facing type name.

### 2.6 `Spark`

**Pro**: Also neuro/firing-coherent; evocative.
**Con**: Already famous as a product name (Apache Spark). Would
trigger unwanted associations.
**Verdict**: No.

### 2.7 `Beat`, `Chime`, `Signal`, `Ping`, `Impulse`

Other candidates considered and rejected on either the collision
or the evocation axis. `Impulse` would work but is too long and too
physics-coded; `Ping` is too network-coded; `Beat` is too music-coded.

## 3. Recommendation

- **Durable**: `Engram`
- **Ephemeral**: `Pulse`
- **Storage trait**: `Substrate`
- **Transport trait**: `Bus`
- **Routing handle**: `Topic`
- **Filter**: `TopicFilter`
- **Sequence id**: `u64` (per-bus, per-topic)
- **Either-medium enum**: `Datum<'a> { Engram(&'a Engram), Pulse(&'a Pulse) }`

The `Signal` name stays retired — it was the old name for Engram, it
stays that way, and we don't reclaim it.

## 4. Module naming

- `crates/roko-core/src/engram.rs` — exists, unchanged
- `crates/roko-core/src/pulse.rs` — new
- `crates/roko-core/src/topic.rs` — new
- `crates/roko-core/src/traits.rs` — extend with `Bus`
- `crates/roko-core/src/datum.rs` — new (defines the `Datum` enum)
- `crates/roko-core/src/topics/mod.rs` — new (canonical topic string constants)
  - `topics/orchestration.rs`
  - `topics/agent.rs`
  - `topics/gate.rs`
  - `topics/safety.rs`
  - `topics/conductor.rs`
  - `topics/substrate.rs`
  - `topics/chain.rs` (Phase 2+)
  - `topics/mesh.rs` (Phase 2+)

## 5. File name for the core docs

- `docs/00-architecture/02a-engram-durable-record.md` (rename from
  `02-engram-data-type.md`, redirect preserved)
- `docs/00-architecture/02b-pulse-ephemeral-event.md` (new)
- `docs/00-architecture/07a-substrate-storage-fabric.md` (rename
  from `07-substrate-trait.md`)
- `docs/00-architecture/07b-bus-transport-fabric.md` (new)

## 6. One-line summary that uses all the names

> Roko's kernel has two mediums (**Engram** — durable, content-addressed,
> decayed; **Pulse** — ephemeral, topic-addressed, sequenced) moving
> through two fabrics (**Substrate** — storage; **Bus** — transport),
> acted on by six operators (**Scorer**, **Gate**, **Router**,
> **Composer**, **Policy**, and the fabric traits themselves). Data
> has lineage via the Engram DAG; events have ordering via Bus
> sequence numbers. Pulses graduate to Engrams when their lineage
> matters.

Every bolded term is a type or trait in `roko-core` after Phase B.

## 7. Topic-namespace registry

The canonical topic names in `roko-core::topics`. Using the constants
(not string literals) lets the compiler catch typos and gives rustdoc
a home for each topic's documentation.

```rust
// roko-core/src/topics/mod.rs
pub mod agent;
pub mod orchestration;
pub mod gate;
pub mod safety;
pub mod conductor;
pub mod substrate;
pub mod consensus;       // from 13-collective-intelligence-c-factor.md
pub mod prediction;      // from 10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops.md
pub mod chain;           // Phase 2+, from 09-phase-2-implications.md
pub mod mesh;            // Phase 2+, from 09-phase-2-implications.md
```

Example of one submodule:

```rust
// roko-core/src/topics/gate.rs
//! Gate-related topic strings.

/// Emitted once per Gate verdict in the pipeline.
/// Body: `Body::Json({ "gate": "compile|test|clippy|...", "passed": bool, "reason": string })`.
pub const VERDICT_EMITTED: &str = "gate.verdict.emitted";

/// Emitted when a Gate pipeline fails overall.
pub const PIPELINE_FAILED: &str = "gate.pipeline.failed";

/// Emitted by a learning Policy computing rolling failure rate.
/// Body: `Body::Json({ "rate": f64, "window_ms": i64 })`.
pub const FAILURE_RATE: &str = "gate.failure.rate";

/// Emitted by a `ConsistencyGate` when an agent output looks
/// semantically disconnected from its cited supporting Engrams.
/// Body: `Body::Json({ "distance": f64, "threshold": f64 })`.
pub const HALLUCINATION_DETECTED: &str = "gate.hallucination.detected";
```

Topic constants are `pub const` strings, not typed wrappers, so they
can be used directly in the `Topic::new(...)` calls throughout the
codebase:

```rust
use roko_core::topics::gate;
bus.publish(Pulse {
    topic: Topic::new(gate::VERDICT_EMITTED),
    ...
}).await?;
```

A future `Topic` newtype could carry stronger validation (the dot-separated
lowercase convention in §2.1 of `02-engram-vs-pulse.md`). Punt that until
the registry has 100+ topics and reader confusion becomes real.

## 8. Reserved topic prefixes

Some prefixes have ecosystem-wide meaning. Plugins and third-party
extensions should avoid them unless they truly fit:

| Prefix | Owner | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestration.*` | `roko-orchestrator` | Plan / task lifecycle |
| `agent.*` | `roko-agent`, `roko-agent-server` | Agent process, turn, token events |
| `gate.*` | `roko-gate` | Gate pipeline verdicts and stats |
| `safety.*` | `roko-agent/safety` | Permission, approval, taint, attestation |
| `conductor.*` | `roko-conductor` | Health, circuit breakers, watchers |
| `substrate.*` | Any Substrate impl | `engram.stored`, `engram.pruned`, `thaw.requested` |
| `consensus.*` | `13-collective-intelligence-c-factor.md` | HDC-bundle consensus |
| `prediction.*`, `outcome.*`, `error.*` | `10-self-learning-cybernetic-loops.md` | Active-inference triples |
| `heartbeat.*` | Clock | Three-speed ticks (gamma, theta, delta) |
| `chain.*` | `roko-chain` (Phase 2+) | On-chain event forwarding |
| `mesh.*` | `roko-mesh` (Phase 2+) | Inter-agent pub/sub |
| `plugin.*` | Plugin registry | Install, enable, disable events |
| `ui.*` | `roko-cli`, `roko-serve` | UI-local state refresh |

Third-party plugins should namespace under their own ID:
`org.example.my_gate.verdict` rather than reusing `gate.*`. This is the
same rule as Kubernetes label keys.

## 9. Deprecated / avoided names

To keep the rename audit honest, this is the list of names we
deliberately avoid using — with reasons — so future maintainers
don't accidentally resurrect them:

| Avoided | Why | Prefer |
|---|---|---|
| `Signal` for an ephemeral event | Collides with the old `Signal → Engram` rename history | `Pulse` |
| `Event` as the primary type name | Collides with tokio/winit/many crates | `Pulse` |
| `Message` | Overloaded with LLM chat messages | `Pulse` (wire), `ChatMessage` (LLM-specific) |
| `Signal` for the durable record | Legacy; renamed to Engram | `Engram` |
| `EventBus<E>` as the trait | Ad-hoc generic; not canonical | `Bus` + `Pulse` |
| `Topic<String>` | Roko uses `Topic` (wraps `String`) | `Topic` |
| `Channel` | Too generic; used by tokio for different things | `Topic` |
| `Envelope` | Sounds like the container, not the thing | `Pulse` |
| `Grimoire` | Previous project name for Neuro | `Neuro` |
| `Styx` | Previous project name for mesh | `Mesh` |
| `Clade` | Previous project name for agent roster | `Fleet` |
| `Bardo`, `Golem`, `Mori` | Previous project codename heritage | `Roko` |

`34-glossary.md` carries the same table plus definitions; this
section is the reason log.

# Batch REF07 — Naming decisions: Pulse/Bus/Topic/Datum across glossary + docs

**Refinement source**: `tmp/refinements/07-naming.md` (injected above under
"Canonical refinement source"). That source is the authoritative proposal;
your job is to propagate its substance into the canonical `docs/` tree.

## Target docs (candidates)

You MAY touch any file under `docs/**` if the refinement applies.
Primary candidates:

- `docs/00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md` — rewrite/extend to canonicalize Pulse, Bus, Topic, TopicFilter, Datum, PulseSource, plus the retired-terms table (Bardo, Golem, Mori, Grimoire, Styx, Clade, Event-as-type-name, EventBus-as-trait, Envelope-as-user-type, Signal-as-ephemeral).
- `docs/00-architecture/INDEX.md` — lead one-liner adopts the canonical vocabulary.

## Required outputs

- Every updated doc retains its filename and stable anchor IDs.
- New content is substantive — section-level or full-file rewrites are
  authorised when a doc is deeply misaligned.
- Cross-references to `tmp/refinements/07-naming.md` appear in each touched file.
- Index docs (`docs/**/INDEX.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`) are updated when a
  new chapter is added or the chapter index needs to reflect the change.
- Glossary updates (if applicable) land in
  `docs/00-architecture/01-naming-and-glossary.md`.
- Retired-terms table must be prominent. Every retired term in `context-pack/02-TERMINOLOGY-TABLE.md` appears here with a Current replacement.

## Required vocabulary (verify)

The verify step greps for: `Pulse|Topic|Datum|Bus`

At least one changed file must mention it (case-insensitive) before the
batch is considered complete.

## Cross-references

Dependents — downstream refinements assuming this one has propagated
into docs: REF34

## Rules

Follow all rules in `context-pack/00-REFINEMENTS-RULES.md`:

- Only touch files under `docs/`. The verify scope gate fails the
  batch otherwise.
- Aggressive edit posture authorised: full-file rewrites allowed when the
  refinement's framing contradicts the existing doc.
- Retired terms (see `context-pack/02-TERMINOLOGY-TABLE.md`) only
  appear in lines explicitly marked retired/deprecated/historical/
  formerly/legacy.
- Substantive edits — no "TODO: rewrite later" placeholders.

## Done when

- Diff gate + scope gate + terminology gate + required-term gate all pass.
- Commit ready with message `refinements(REF07): Naming decisions: Pulse/Bus/Topic/Datum across glossary + docs`.
- Final message lists: files changed, any new files added, any retired
  disclaimers removed, cross-references added, follow-ups identified.
