# Dashboard PRD Plan: Design Language

**Source:** `/Users/will/dev/nunchi/nunchi-dashboard/docs/prd/07-design-language.md`
**Generated:** 2026-04-25
**Source hash:** `c6059b7fcda0345c754454e78664b8cff80198b2cd3a53f7024ea5681f902ba6`
**Section tasks:** 107
**Context mode:** full source section embedded in every task; no excerpt truncation.
**Quality threshold:** every task must score at least 9.5/10 before implementation begins.

## Purpose
Turn every dashboard PRD section into explicit backend-support work. Even visual/frontend sections must produce backend projection, telemetry, fixture, schema, or explicit no-backend rationale so frontend implementation is easy and stable.

## Global Implementation Rules
- Extend existing modules before creating new ones; only add new route/service files when no canonical owner exists.
- Implement production wiring, not only structs, mocks, or isolated helpers.
- Preserve every extracted detail unless a parity-ledger row explicitly marks it covered or deferred.
- Add persistence, events, auth/safety, dashboard projections, and docs updates whenever the requirement reaches those surfaces.
- A checked box means code, tests, docs, parity ledger, and strict gates are done for that task.

## Primary Target Areas
- `crates/roko-serve/src/routes/config.rs`
- `crates/roko-serve/src/routes/projections.rs`
- `crates/roko-core/src/config/schema.rs`

- `contracts/src/`
- `crates/roko-chain/src/`
- `apps/mirage-rs/src/`
- `.roko/parity/docs-ledger.json`

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

## Why this document matters

The design language is not decoration. It is a system of choices where every visual element maps to something true about the product. When that mapping is consistent, users can read the interface before they consciously interpret it. When the mapping is inconsistent or absent, the interface is harder to use and the aesthetic becomes noise.

This document specifies the palette, typography, glass morphism layers, motion patterns, and the correspondence principle that governs the relationship between visual form and underlying system state. It sets the baseline for the reactive-aesthetics system specified in `08-epistemic-aesthetics.md`, which modulates specific visual properties in response to measurable quantities.

Readers implementing the dashboard should treat this document as the authoritative specification for static visual properties (colors, type, spacing, component styling) and `08-epistemic-aesthetics.md` as authoritative for dynamic visual modulation. Together they define the full visual system.

Readers designing new surfaces or components should read both before proposing changes. The design language is a tight system — arbitrary additions dilute its coherence.

## The correspondence principle

Every visual decision in the Nunchi dashboard maps to something true about the system. This is the correspondence principle, and it is the highest-priority design constraint.

The principle sounds simple but is frequently violated in practice. A typical pattern: a designer chooses a color because it looks good, chooses a font because it feels appropriate, chooses a motion pattern because it is trendy. Each decision is reasonable in isolation; together they produce an interface whose visual choices do not mean anything. Users must learn the interface by rote because no visual element predicts its semantic.

The Nunchi dashboard inverts this. Every color, every material, every motion carries information. Users who have internalized the mappings can read the interface faster than they can read labels. The interface becomes legible before it is read.

Examples of the correspondence principle applied:

- Reputation tiers use metal colors (gray, copper, silver, gold, amber) because reputation is forged through sustained accumulation of external-eval outcomes. Metals are culturally understood as earned. Plain color could not carry this meaning.
- Glass morphism creates depth because information has layered importance. A glass card "floats" above the void because its content is elevated from the substrate. Deeper glass means more prominent content.
- Knowledge entries fade as they decay because decay is loss of signal, and visual fading is the natural visual metaphor. A stale entry should look stale.
- Motion easing is slow and deliberate because the system represents consequence. Bouncy motion would suggest the UI is playful and consequence-free, which would contradict what the product does.

New visual choices must pass the correspondence test: what about the system is this encoding, and is the encoding true? Visual choices that cannot articulate an answer should be revised.

- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Verification: add deterministic unit, integration, route/CLI, auth/safety, persistence/restart, serialization, and failing-path tests; avoid LLM self-grading where ground truth is required.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

## Landing page treatment

The landing page applies the ROSEDUST design language at marketing scale with additional premium treatments documented in `docs/landing/03-design-refinement.md`. Key extensions:

- **Persistent ambient Three.js background** — extremely subtle particle field (stars, HDC lattice, pheromones) behind all sections, `position: fixed`, z-index 0. Particles are faint enough to be felt not seen.
- **Glass section backing** — each content section has a `rgba(6,6,8,0.75)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` panel so text is readable against the particle layer.
- **Holographic wireframe aesthetic** — all Three.js scene objects use `MeshBasicMaterial` (no lighting) with `EdgesGeometry` overlay for a delicate holographic look.
- **`.btn-premium` micro-interactions** — hover lift (-1px) + active press (scale 0.98) on all interactive elements.
- **Rose-tinted warmth** — glass borders, nav borders, and hover glows use rose at very low opacity (0.04-0.08) to give the interface perceived temperature.

## Inheritance from ROSEDUST

ROSEDUST is the design system developed for the Bardo/Golem era of the product. It is mostly transferable to Nunchi. The core visual vocabulary — void backgrounds, rose primary, bone as earned accent, metals for tiers, engineering-aesthetic vocabulary, three-tier glass morphism, three fonts with three jobs, luxury motion easing — moves forward unchanged.

Some aspects of ROSEDUST were specific to the Bardo era and do not transfer:

- **Mortality-first framing.** ROSEDUST originally encoded a Golem's mortality as a central visual property (vitality gauges, death cinematics, terminal-phase palette shifts). Nunchi treats mortality as an opt-in feature. The visual vocabulary for economic state (runway, budget) survives; the "dying agent" aesthetic language retires.
- **Intimate single-agent register.** ROSEDUST was designed around a user sitting with one Golem at a 60fps terminal. Nunchi operates at fleet, group, and network scale. The palette and materiality stay constant; density, focal depth, and information architecture scale up.
- **Creature portraiture as primary identity.** In the Bardo era, the creature sprite (bardo-sprites WASM module) was the primary representation of an agent. Nunchi may still use creature portraits (see `09-visualization-primitives.md` on generative agent portraits), but they are one representation among many. Name, reputation tier badge, and capabilities are equally first-class.

The documents specified here assume ROSEDUST as the foundation. Where this specification diverges from ROSEDUST, the divergence is called out explicitly. Where it does not, assume ROSEDUST is the baseline.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Runtime: wire into the production agent loop with lifecycle, cancellation, health, audit, provider/tool safety, and observable events.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Foundation

The foundation is a set of near-black surfaces. Never pure `#000000`. Pure black on a modern screen produces a "hole in the screen" effect that is visually unsettling; a touch of warmth reads as depth.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--void` | `#060608` | Page background, the deepest surface. |
| `--surface-1` | `#0A0A0C` | Elevated sections, sidebar backgrounds. |
| `--surface-2` | `#111114` | Secondary elevation (cards, panels). |
| `--surface-3` | `#18181C` | Tertiary elevation (nested cards, popovers). |

These four surfaces establish the vertical depth of the interface. Layered content reads as layered because the background beneath each layer is subtly lighter than the layer below it.

### Rose (primary)

Rose is the primary color. It is deployed for active states, primary calls to action, links, highlights, and accent borders. Rose is warm and inviting against the void, but restrained enough that it does not dominate.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--rose` | `#D4A5A5` | Primary rose. Active states, CTAs. |
| `--rose-bright` | `#E8BEBE` | Emphasis, hover states on primary elements. |
| `--rose-dim` | `rgba(212, 165, 165, 0.24)` | Borders at rest, section dividers, subtle fills. |
| `--rose-mid` | `rgba(212, 165, 165, 0.48)` | Borders on hover, scrollbar thumb. |
| `--rose-glow` | `rgba(212, 165, 165, 0.08)` | Glow backgrounds, ghost fills. |

Rose is not used for critical information. An error is not rose; a warning is not rose. Rose is the product's signature color and communicates "this is something to engage with."

- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Bone (earned accent)

Bone is the restrained accent. It is used for the single most important element on screen. If you use bone, it should be because that element is meaningfully more significant than anything else visible.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--bone` | `#EFE8D8` | Primary bone. Headlines on marquee surfaces, hero statistics. |
| `--bone-dim` | `rgba(239, 232, 216, 0.20)` | Very subtle borders on bone-accented elements. |

Bone loses its power when overused. A page with five bone elements has no bone elements — users cannot tell what is most important. A good rule: at most one bone element per viewport.

- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.

### Tier metals

Reputation tiers use metals, in order of increasing value. The colors are drawn from how real metals look, not stylized.

| Tier | Name | Token | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| I | Unverified | `--tier-gray` | `#4A4A50` |
| II | Basic | `--tier-copper` | `#8B5E3C` |
| III | Verified | `--tier-silver` | `#A0A0A8` |
| IV | Trusted | `--tier-gold` | `#C9A84C` |
| V | Sovereign | `--tier-amber` | `#E8A020` |

Tier metals are deployed for reputation badges, agent identity indicators, and anywhere the user needs to know an entity's tier at a glance. Because they encode tier semantically, they are not to be used for non-tier decoration.

### Semantic colors

Some colors encode specific meanings. They are used sparingly and only where the meaning applies.

| Token | Value | Semantic |
|---|---|---|
| `--success` | `#7AAB7D` | Pass, success, healthy state. |
| `--warn` | `#D4A954` | Warning, caution. |
| `--error` | `#C17570` | Failure, critical issue. |
| `--info` | `#7A9CC6` | Informational, neutral. |
| `--threat` | `#C17570` | Threat pheromones (shares error color, intentional). |
| `--opportunity` | `#D4A954` | Opportunity pheromones (shares warn color, intentional). |
| `--wisdom` | `#7AAB7D` | Wisdom pheromones (shares success color, intentional). |

Semantic colors are muted. They do not shout. A page with a genuine error uses the error color; a page without errors does not use warning tones to add visual interest.

- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Text

Text colors are layered by importance.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--text-primary` | `#EFE8D8` | Primary text. Equivalent to bone; same hue. |
| `--text-secondary` | `#A8A296` | Secondary text. Labels, metadata. |
| `--text-tertiary` | `#706B63` | Tertiary text. Disabled, less-important labels. |
| `--text-muted` | `#45423E` | Muted text. Near-invisible; for subtle notations. |

Body text uses `--text-primary` on surfaces, `--text-secondary` for metadata, and `--text-tertiary` for less-important context. Tertiary text should pass accessibility contrast requirements against the surface it sits on (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large).

- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.

### The three fonts

**Instrument Serif** — for authority, for display headlines, for section titles that want to carry weight. Italic variants used for descriptions beneath section headings (a ROSEDUST pattern that is retained and expanded).

**General Sans** — for body text, UI labels, navigation, descriptions, most readable text. A neutral, highly readable sans-serif.

**JetBrains Mono** — for data, addresses, numbers, timestamps, code, and any content where monospaced precision matters. Mono font for data because data is truth.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.

### Typography principles

**Italic serif is the voice of description.** When a section or page needs a descriptive sentence that sets the tone, it is Instrument Serif Italic. This voice is distinctive and appears across the dashboard as the product's narrative layer. Examples: "Real-time chain state, fleet census, and collective intelligence. Every block carries forward what agents learned." on the Command Center.

**Mono for all numbers that are data.** A cost, a count, an address, an ID, a timestamp, a hash, a score — all mono. Text in a card describing an event uses sans, but any numerical value within the text shifts to mono inline. This creates clear visual distinction between prose and data.

**Caps labels for structural markers.** Short uppercase labels with letter spacing mark structural elements: section names in the sidebar, badge labels on cards (`PULSE`, `FLEET`, `KNOWLEDGE`, `ARENA`), status tags. These labels read as navigational anchors, not body content.

**Serif for emphasis, not decoration.** Instrument Serif is a strong, distinctive face. It should be used where its weight is warranted — titles, headings, descriptions. Using it for body text would overwhelm. Using it for small labels would be illegible.

**Hierarchy through scale, not color.** Text hierarchy is established primarily by size and weight, secondarily by color. A page's H1 is large and serif; its H2 is medium and serif; its H3 is smaller and sans. All use similar colors (`--text-primary`). Color is reserved for semantic distinctions (error, success) rather than hierarchy.

- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**

- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### DASH-07-S018 -- Line length and leading

**Source section:** `/Users/will/dev/nunchi/nunchi-dashboard/docs/prd/07-design-language.md:202` through `209`
**Heading level:** H3
**Concern split:** `api`, `realtime`, `storage`, `chain`, `dashboard-support`, `config-deployment`
**Implementation status:** `[ ] not started` `[ ] in progress` `[ ] implemented` `[ ] verified`

**Full source context for this task:**

````markdown
### Line length and leading

Body text line length: 60–80 characters. Paragraphs that stretch wider become hard to read; the layout should enforce line length constraints on long-form text.

Line height (leading): 1.5 for body, 1.3 for headings, 1.4 for mono. Generous leading improves readability on dark backgrounds, where tight leading can feel cramped.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.

## Glass morphism

The three-tier glass system from ROSEDUST is retained. Glass layers communicate hierarchy through transparency and blur, without introducing color. A page with glass layers has visible depth — content floats above content below — but stays within the tonal palette.

### Three layers

| Level | Background | Border | Blur |
|---|---|---|---|
| Glass-1 (Subtle) | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.02)` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` | 12px |
| Glass-2 (Standard) | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.04)` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)` | 20px |
| Glass-3 (Prominent) | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06)` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)` | 30px |

Usage patterns:

- **Glass-1**: section backgrounds, panel backgrounds. Barely-visible layer that distinguishes a panel from its substrate without drawing attention.
- **Glass-2**: standard cards. Most cards on most pages use this layer.
- **Glass-3**: prominent cards. Hero stats, primary call-to-action cards, the single most important card on a page. Reserve for emphasis.

Glass layers can nest. A Glass-1 panel can contain Glass-2 cards, which can contain a Glass-3 accent within. This creates the layered depth the system encodes.

Glass cards for entities with tiers (agents, knowledge entries, arenas) may include a tier-metal border accent. The border is subtle — a 1px line in the tier metal color at low opacity — visible enough to communicate tier at a glance without overwhelming the glass's own visual language.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Runtime: wire into the production agent loop with lifecycle, cancellation, health, audit, provider/tool safety, and observable events.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.
- Knowledge/learning: preserve provenance, confidence, lineage, decay, retrieval, promotion/demotion, episode signals, and queryable outputs.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Timing functions

Three canonical easing curves:

| Token | Curve | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--ease-luxury` | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` | Primary easing. Slow start, quick middle, slow stop. Standard page transitions, card hovers, most motion. |
| `--ease-subtle` | `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` | Subtle easing. Near-linear with gentle start/stop. Micro-interactions, hover tints, small state changes. |
| `--ease-emphasis` | `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.1, 0.64, 1)` | Emphasis easing. Slight overshoot at the end. Used sparingly for moments that deserve a touch of weight. |

Bounce curves are not used. The design language is deliberate, not playful.

- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Full source context for this task:**

````markdown
### Duration

Durations follow a scale:

- `120ms` — micro-interactions (tooltips, hover highlights).
- `200ms` — state transitions (toggling, selecting).
- `320ms` — card transitions (hover elevation, entry animations).
- `480ms` — page transitions, major state changes.
- `800ms+` — revealing detailed surfaces, first-load reveals, narrative moments.

Longer animations are rare. Most of the dashboard's motion is in the 120–320ms range.

**Full source context for this task:**

````markdown
### Standard motion patterns

**Page fade-in.** On navigation, new pages fade in (opacity 0 → 1) over 200ms with `--ease-luxury`. Content within the page staggers in with 50ms delay between sections, creating a cascade that reveals structure.

**Card hover.** Cards elevate on hover: subtle scale (1.005x), slight border brightening, slight glass opacity increase, over 320ms with `--ease-luxury`. The effect is restrained — cards lift, they do not jump.

**Scroll reveal.** Content below the fold fades and rises into view as it enters the viewport, using IntersectionObserver. Threshold: 100px before entering. Distance: 12px rise. Duration: 400ms. This is a ROSEDUST pattern retained.

**State change.** When a value changes (a counter ticks, a progress bar advances, a status updates), the change animates over 200ms. Abrupt jumps are avoided; values ease to new positions.

**New item appearance.** When a new item appears in a list (new event, new agent, new knowledge entry), it fades in from 0 to 1 opacity over 320ms and height-expands from 0 to its natural height. The list below shifts down smoothly.

**Old item departure.** When an item is removed, it fades out over 200ms and height-collapses to 0, then the list shifts up. This is the mirror of appearance.

**Live number glyphs.** Mono numbers that update frequently (block heights, counts) use a subtle "tick" animation: brief brightening and scale (1.02x) over 120ms, then return. The effect is barely perceptible but communicates liveness.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Negative space as a feature

The dashboard uses generous negative space. Dense interfaces feel crowded and communicate stress; the Nunchi dashboard communicates care. Cards have ample internal padding. Sections have ample separation. Text has generous line heights.

This is not decorative restraint — negative space is a design choice that communicates "this system is thoughtful, this information is significant, take your time." A crowded UI suggests urgency; an airy UI suggests consideration.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### PCB traces

Thin rose or bone lines that trace paths across surfaces, suggesting circuit traces. Used decoratively on hero stat cards (the "PcbCard" in ROSEDUST), on the stigmergy field visualization, and on cards whose contents are infrastructural. Lines are 1px, low opacity, subtle.

PCB traces should look functional, not ornamental. The patterns follow logical paths (right-angle turns, parallel lines, terminal dots), not organic curves.

### Hexagonal and octagonal forms

Hexagonal connectors and octagonal clip-paths appear in places where "this is computational, not organic" wants to be emphasized. Tier badges can be hexagonal. Some card corners can be octagonal. The shapes communicate underlying structure.

Use sparingly. An entire page of hexagons reads as theme, not substance.

### DASH-07-S039 -- Terminal and grid styling

**Source section:** `/Users/will/dev/nunchi/nunchi-dashboard/docs/prd/07-design-language.md:357` through `360`
**Heading level:** H3
**Concern split:** `api`, `realtime`, `storage`, `chain`, `dashboard-support`, `config-deployment`

````markdown
### Terminal and grid styling

The current Nunchi dashboard uses terminal-grid styling (monospaced labels, uppercase section markers, grid-aligned content). This is effective and retained. The visual register is "scientific instrument" rather than "consumer app."

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Card grids

Most content is laid out in grids of cards. Grids reflow responsively:

- Wide viewports: 2, 3, or 4 columns depending on content.
- Narrow viewports: stack vertically.

Card heights align (use flexbox or grid, not fixed heights). Cards feel like a composed system, not an accumulation.

````markdown
### Tables

Tables use the `DataTable` component pattern from ROSEDUST. Column headers in caps style, data rows in mono where values are numeric. Alternating row backgrounds are subtle (barely visible). Hover highlights entire rows. Sort indicators are small triangles.

Tables support virtual scrolling for large data sets (100+ rows).

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Implement or verify `DataTable` in the canonical crate with serde/validation/defaults where it is a data type, and unit tests for boundary behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Full source context for this task:**

````markdown
## The visual system's scale range

The design language scales from intimate (one user, one agent, quiet) to planetary (thousands of agents, a network). The palette and materiality stay constant; density, focal depth, and information architecture shift with scope.

At intimate scale (Agent Detail, Entry Detail), pages have room to breathe. Typography is larger, margins are generous, individual elements are prominent.

At fleet scale (Agent Fleet, Cost Analytics), information density rises. Typography shrinks slightly, cards pack more tightly, aggregate patterns take precedence over individual detail.

At network scale (Network Pulse, Leaderboard in Global Lens), density is higher still. Overview visualizations replace individual cards; aggregate trends are foregrounded.

The transition is smooth, not abrupt. Users who move from Agent Detail (intimate) to Agent Fleet (fleet) to Network Pulse (network) experience a gradual shift in density that matches the shift in scope.

## Extending the design language

When new surfaces or components need visual treatment not covered here, apply the correspondence principle.

Ask: what about the system is this visual element encoding? Is the encoding true? Is it consistent with existing encodings?

If the element encodes something the system does not actually express (an aesthetic preference, a designer's taste), it probably should not be added. If the element encodes something the system does express but no existing visual primitive captures, a new primitive may be warranted — but new primitives are added carefully, not casually.

Extensions to the design language are reviewed against the full document set. A new primitive that makes surface A better but breaks consistency with surface B is not ready for adoption.

- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

## What this document does not specify

This document specifies the static visual system. It does not specify:

- How visual properties react to system state — that is `08-epistemic-aesthetics.md`.
- The specific visualization primitives for system concepts (stigmergy fields, resonance graphs, etc.) — that is `09-visualization-primitives.md`.
- How real-time data flows into motion — that is `10-realtime-and-motion.md`.
- Per-page visual compositions — those are in Section IV.

Together these documents define the full visual system. This one is the foundation.

- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Enforce state transition `surface-1 -> surface-2` with invalid-transition rejection tests and persistence/restart behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

- `apps/mirage-rs/src/`
- `.roko/parity/docs-ledger.json`

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.

- `.roko/parity/docs-ledger.json`

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Implement or verify `img` in the canonical crate with serde/validation/defaults where it is a data type, and unit tests for boundary behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

- `.roko/parity/docs-ledger.json`

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Emit or consume `tokens.css` through the production event bus with sequence id, timestamp, actor, workspace, replay behavior, and WS/SSE coverage if user-visible.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.

- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Runtime: wire into the production agent loop with lifecycle, cancellation, health, audit, provider/tool safety, and observable events.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Implement or verify `spin` in the canonical crate with serde/validation/defaults where it is a data type, and unit tests for boundary behavior.
- [ ] Emit or consume `tokens.css` through the production event bus with sequence id, timestamp, actor, workspace, replay behavior, and WS/SSE coverage if user-visible.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.
- Knowledge/learning: preserve provenance, confidence, lineage, decay, retrieval, promotion/demotion, episode signals, and queryable outputs.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**

- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.

- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**

#### Amplified atmosphere
- **Vignette**: tighter transparency center (30% vs 35%), stronger edge darkness (0.65 vs 0.55), warmer rose bleed at top-left (0.07 vs 0.055), cooler dream-blue at bottom-right (0.055 vs 0.045), and a new 5th gradient — a rose wash at the top edge that gives the sensation of light leaking in from above
- **Grain drift**: the noise texture now subtly drifts via `grain-drift` (8s, 2px translate shifts) — the grain is alive, not static. Like CRT phosphor decay.
- **Opacity bump**: subtle mode elevated from `{0.10, 0.035, 0.70}` to `{0.14, 0.045, 0.80}`; default mode from `{0.18, 0.055, 0.85}` to `{0.22, 0.065, 0.90}`. The atmosphere is now perceptible without being distracting.
- **Dashboard atmosphere**: upgraded from `intensity="subtle"` to `intensity="default"` — the app-shell atmosphere now matches the intended CRT feel.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.
- Knowledge/learning: preserve provenance, confidence, lineage, decay, retrieval, promotion/demotion, episode signals, and queryable outputs.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

#### ChassisFrame inner atmosphere
When `live` is true, each ChassisFrame gets an additional `inset 0 0 80px rgba(212,165,165,0.015)` warm inner radial glow — the module appears to emit faint rose light from within, like instruments with backlit panels. The head and foot bars now use `linear-gradient(90deg)` that peaks at the center and fades to void at the edges — creating the illusion of overhead light falling on the module's control strip.

#### Sidebar ambient edge
The sidebar's right edge now has a `::after` pseudo-element — a 1px rose-dim vertical line spanning the middle 60% of the sidebar, animated via `edge-glow` (4s opacity oscillation 0.4→0.7). This gives the sidebar boundary a breathing, almost bioluminescent quality instead of a hard line.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

#### Epistemic sharpness glow tiers

The PRD specifies that visual glow should scale with `epistemic_sharpness = confidence * validation * recency`. Three CSS tiers implement the initial version:

| Class | Sharpness range | Visual treatment |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| `.epistemic-bright` | 0.8–1.0 | Bone-tinted box-shadow (16px), ring (1px), top-edge highlight — the entry radiates authority |
| `.epistemic-mid` | 0.4–0.8 | Rose-tinted box-shadow (8px), ring (1px) — the entry has earned some presence |
| `.epistemic-dim` | 0.0–0.4 | Opacity 0.6, saturation 0.7 — the entry is fading, unvalidated, or stale |

These classes are applied to Card and ChassisFrame elements based on the sharpness score of the content they display. When an entry crosses a tier boundary, the transition occurs via `--ease-luxury` at `--duration-card`.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Verification: add deterministic unit, integration, route/CLI, auth/safety, persistence/restart, serialization, and failing-path tests; avoid LLM self-grading where ground truth is required.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Verification: add deterministic unit, integration, route/CLI, auth/safety, persistence/restart, serialization, and failing-path tests; avoid LLM self-grading where ground truth is required.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.
- Knowledge/learning: preserve provenance, confidence, lineage, decay, retrieval, promotion/demotion, episode signals, and queryable outputs.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Enforce state transition `border-standard -> rose-dim` with invalid-transition rejection tests and persistence/restart behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

| Class | Tier | Rhythm | Semantic |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| `.heartbeat-t0` | T0 (Gamma) | 0.8s — fast, subtle | Reflex-path processing, nearly invisible |
| `.heartbeat-t1` | T1 (Theta) | 2s — medium | Deliberation-tier processing |
| `.heartbeat-t2` | T2 (Delta) | 4s — slow, pronounced | Frontier-model deep reasoning |

Applied to agent status indicators and card accents. "Users can see, at a glance, whether an agent is cognitively active."

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Runtime: wire into the production agent loop with lifecycle, cancellation, health, audit, provider/tool safety, and observable events.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

#### ChassisFrame: instrument-grade upgrade

Every ChassisFrame module now has three new ambient details:

- **Scanner sweep**: when `live` is true, a faint horizontal light sweep (30% width, rose at 4% opacity) traverses the head bar every 8s. This is the "heartbeat of the instrument" — you feel it before you see it.
- **Inner scanlines**: the body area has a `--atmosphere-scanline` overlay at 4% opacity with `multiply` blend — connecting the module's interior to the CRT atmosphere of the page.
- **PCB trace corners**: `.pcb-corner` adds faint L-shaped circuit-trace decorations at top-left and bottom-right corners of the body — rose at 4-5% opacity. "Should look functional, not ornamental."

- `.roko/parity/docs-ledger.json`

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Implement or verify `SectionLabel` in the canonical crate with serde/validation/defaults where it is a data type, and unit tests for boundary behavior.
- [ ] Implement or verify `rose` in the canonical crate with serde/validation/defaults where it is a data type, and unit tests for boundary behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### DASH-07-S102 -- CognitiveFrequencyBar: alive bars

**Source section:** `/Users/will/dev/nunchi/nunchi-dashboard/docs/prd/07-design-language.md:746` through `752`

**Full source context for this task:**

````markdown
#### CognitiveFrequencyBar: alive bars

The three-band cognitive frequency meter now has:
- **Leading-edge glow**: each bar's fill emits light from its leading edge (`2px 0 6px` in the band's color) when value > 10%. The bar is alive, not painted.
- **Inner top highlight**: `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.15)` on the fill — simulated cylindrical surface
- **Recessed track**: `.track-inset` applied to gauge tracks — the channel feels physically cut into the surface

#### Main content ambient warmth

`.dark main::before` is a fixed-position two-gradient overlay — rose warmth at upper-left (45%/30%), dream-blue coolness at lower-right (70%/70%). Pointer-events none, z-index 0. This creates a barely-perceptible "studio lighting" effect across the content area — warmer where your eye naturally falls, cooler at the periphery.

### DASH-07-S105 -- Surface grain texture

**Source section:** `/Users/will/dev/nunchi/nunchi-dashboard/docs/prd/07-design-language.md:761` through `764`
**Heading level:** H4
**Concern split:** `api`, `realtime`, `storage`, `chain`, `dashboard-support`, `config-deployment`
**Implementation status:** `[ ] not started` `[ ] in progress` `[ ] implemented` `[ ] verified`

**Full source context for this task:**

````markdown
#### Surface grain texture

`.surface-grain` adds a `::before` pseudo-element with `--atmosphere-grain` at 1.5% opacity, `overlay` blend mode. Applied to elevated surfaces to give them the same CRT noise texture as the atmosphere layer. The surface is not smooth — it has depth.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Implement or verify `overlay` in the canonical crate with serde/validation/defaults where it is a data type, and unit tests for boundary behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/07-design-language
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
