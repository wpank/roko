# Dashboard PRD Plan: Composition Patterns

**Source:** `/Users/will/dev/nunchi/nunchi-dashboard/docs/prd/20-composition-patterns.md`
**Generated:** 2026-04-25
**Source hash:** `89301ca11cd4ce007c20e41c67765a6e19bfb833243e601720260da8cf5159f8`
**Section tasks:** 25
**Context mode:** full source section embedded in every task; no excerpt truncation.
**Quality threshold:** every task must score at least 9.5/10 before implementation begins.

## Purpose
Turn every dashboard PRD section into explicit backend-support work. Even visual/frontend sections must produce backend projection, telemetry, fixture, schema, or explicit no-backend rationale so frontend implementation is easy and stable.

## Global Implementation Rules
- Extend existing modules before creating new ones; only add new route/service files when no canonical owner exists.
- Implement production wiring, not only structs, mocks, or isolated helpers.
- Preserve every extracted detail unless a parity-ledger row explicitly marks it covered or deferred.
- Add persistence, events, auth/safety, dashboard projections, and docs updates whenever the requirement reaches those surfaces.
- A checked box means code, tests, docs, parity ledger, and strict gates are done for that task.

## Primary Target Areas
- `crates/roko-serve/src/routes/projections.rs`
- `crates/roko-serve/src/events.rs`

- `contracts/src/`
- `crates/roko-chain/src/`
- `apps/mirage-rs/src/`
- `.roko/parity/docs-ledger.json`

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/20-composition-patterns
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

## Why this document matters

Thesis 6 from `02-theses-and-principles.md` says the system is composed of primitives: a small set of first-class objects that combine in unlimited ways to produce the product's capabilities. This document specifies the composition patterns — the recurring ways that primitives combine — and the principles that keep composition coherent as the system grows.

Understanding composition matters for three reasons. First, users who understand composition can build more with the same primitives — a user who understands that an arena is a task source plus a gate pipeline plus a scoring function can design arenas they could not otherwise imagine. Second, implementers who understand composition can build surfaces that expose it — instead of specialized UIs per complex object, the dashboard uses the same compositional moves across the product. Third, the recursion at the heart of thesis 8 (tools for tools) only works if composition is consistent — a meta-agent composing an agent uses the same composition pattern the user would use by hand.

This document is shorter than most in the spec set, because the primitives and their instantiations are specified elsewhere. What lives here is the grammar.

### DASH-20-S003 -- The primitives (recap)

## The primitives (recap)

Ten first-class object types, documented in `01-system-landscape.md`. Recapped here:

- **Agent** — a Roko runtime instance with identity, configuration, and capabilities.
- **Extension** — a modular unit of behavior an agent can load.
- **Gate** — a verification step checking output against ground truth.
- **Domain** — a declarative specification shaping a class of agents.
- **Knowledge entry** — a unit of validated information.
- **Arena** — an evaluation environment with task source, gates, scoring, leaderboard.
- **Eval** — a measurement of behavior against external ground truth.
- **Pheromone** — a stigmergic signal.
- **Group** — a coordinated subset of agents.
- **Bounty** — a user-posted task with a reward.

> **Note:** This document defines the original 10-primitive vocabulary. PRD 23 (`23-universal-primitives.md`) extends this to 12 primitives by adding Connector, Feed, and Recipe, renaming Pheromone→Signal, and merging Domain into Agent. Extension is preserved as-is for Pi ecosystem compatibility (see PRD-09 three-tier extension taxonomy). The composition grammar and DAW principle defined here remain fully applicable to the expanded set.

Plus supporting objects: templates, plans, meta-agents, generators. These are themselves compositions of primitives rather than new primitive types.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

````markdown
### Pattern 1 — Agent as composition

An agent is not a monolith. It is a composition:

```
Agent = Domain + Extensions + Gates + Knowledge Store + Model Routing + Budget + Caveats + Heartbeat Schedule + Identity
```

Each component is itself specifiable and swappable. An agent with a different gate pipeline is a different agent. An agent with different extensions is a different agent.

This composition is exposed in the Agent Composer (`19-authoring-surfaces.md`). Users compose an agent by selecting values for each component. Templates pre-fill all components; domain-based starting points pre-fill the domain-dependent components; manual configuration adjusts specifics.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Agent Detail exposes the composition. Users can see, for each agent, its constituent parts.
- Changing a component is a first-class edit. Changing an agent's model routing is an explicit, revertible operation.
- Comparing agents means comparing compositions. "How does this agent differ from that one" shows per-component diffs.

### Pattern 2 — Arena as composition

An arena is a composition:

```
Arena = Task Source + Gate Configuration + Scoring Function + Leaderboard Rules + Economic Parameters + Metadata
```

Arenas become distinctive by the choices at each component. A coding arena differs from a trading arena in task source, in gate configuration, and in scoring function — not in "being a coding arena."

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Arena Constructor (`19-authoring-surfaces.md`) exposes each component.
- Arena Detail shows each component.
- Users can fork an arena and modify any component.
- Cross-arena analytics (how do scoring functions correlate with participant behavior?) are possible because arenas have typed components.

### Pattern 3 — Eval as composition

An eval is a composition:

```
Eval = Measurement Target Type + Ground Truth Source + Scoring Function + Input Spec + Output Spec + Calibration Plan
```

The ground truth source is especially important per thesis 4 — it is what makes the eval meaningful. Composing different ground truth sources with the same scoring function produces different evals.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Eval Author (`19-authoring-surfaces.md`) exposes each component. Ground truth source is a blocking field.
- Evals can be composed: an eval whose score is a weighted combination of other evals' scores.
- Meta-evals specifically evaluate the composition — is the ground truth source well-specified, is the scoring function sensible, is the calibration good.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Verification: add deterministic unit, integration, route/CLI, auth/safety, persistence/restart, serialization, and failing-path tests; avoid LLM self-grading where ground truth is required.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Add or verify config key `Eval = Measurement Target Type + Ground Truth Source + Scoring Function + Input Spec + Output Spec + Calibration Plan` with schema validation, default, docs, env override if applicable, and hot-reload/restart-required behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/20-composition-patterns
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Pattern 4 — Plan as composition

A plan is a composition of tasks with dependencies:

```
Plan = Set of Tasks + Dependency Graph + Success Criteria + Error Handling + Checkpoints
```

Each task, in turn, is a composition:

```
Task = Agent Assignment + Input Specification + Output Specification + Gate Requirements + Success Criterion
```

Plans nest — a plan containing sub-plans forms a hierarchy. The hierarchy is what makes plans expressive enough for real work.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Plan Designer (`19-authoring-surfaces.md`) exposes the DAG and per-task composition.
- Execution (Forge) shows the plan's current state task by task.
- Replay allows stepping through plan execution.

### Pattern 5 — Group as composition

A group is a composition of agents with coordination rules:

```
Group = Members + Coordination Protocol + Shared State + Governance + Goals
```

Groups can contain agents from different owners. The coordination protocol determines how they work together. Shared state (knowledge, budget, pheromones) is accessible to all members within governance rules.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Groups page in Fleet exposes the composition.
- Each group has its own Group Detail page with members, protocol, state.
- Groups can participate in arenas as a unit; arena scoring can be per-group rather than per-agent.

### Pattern 6 — Meta-agent as composition

A meta-agent is an agent with agent-creation tools:

```
Meta-Agent = Agent + Target Specification + Agent-Creation Tools + Child Caveats + Safety Boundaries
```

The meta-agent is still an agent — all the same composition rules apply. The additions are what distinguish it as a meta-agent.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Meta-Agent Studio (`19-authoring-surfaces.md`) reuses Agent Composer with additional stages.
- Meta-agent surfaces are agent surfaces with meta-specific sections.
- A meta-agent's children are regular agents, with their own composition.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Runtime: wire into the production agent loop with lifecycle, cancellation, health, audit, provider/tool safety, and observable events.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Add or verify config key `Meta-Agent = Agent + Target Specification + Agent-Creation Tools + Child Caveats + Safety Boundaries` with schema validation, default, docs, env override if applicable, and hot-reload/restart-required behavior.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/20-composition-patterns
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Pattern 7 — Generator as composition

A generator produces new first-class objects:

```
Generator = Target Type + Generation Logic + Quality Criteria + Publication Policy
```

A generator is not itself an agent — it is a specification of how to produce instances. However, generators often include an agent (or call one) as part of their generation logic.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Generator Studio exposes the composition.
- Generator outputs have lineage back to the generator.
- Meta-Lineage traces generator outputs alongside agent lineage.

### Pattern 8 — Knowledge composition

Knowledge entries compose in two ways:

**Lineage composition:** an entry may be derived from other entries. A synthesis entry cites its sources. The lineage graph makes this composition explicit.

**Retrieval composition:** multiple entries retrieved for the same context compose into the context assembly. The cognitive workspace is a runtime composition of entries plus structured content.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Knowledge Lineage exposes lineage composition.
- Context Audit exposes retrieval composition.
- Entry Detail shows both incoming and outgoing lineage.

- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/20-composition-patterns
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

### Pattern 10 — Domain composition

A domain is a higher-order composition:

```
Domain = Extension Set + Default Gate Pipeline + Context Strategy + Model Preferences + Heartbeat Schedule + Metadata
```

Domains compose with agents: an agent "has a domain" in the sense that its configuration inherits from the domain's defaults.

**Implications for the dashboard:**

- Domain Builder exposes the composition.
- Agents created from a domain show their inheritance.
- Domain changes propagate (with user consent) to agents using the domain.

### DASH-20-S015 -- The DAW principle

## The DAW principle

The Digital Audio Workstation analogy is a guiding principle. A DAW gives musicians:

- **A small number of primitive objects.** Tracks, clips, instruments, effects, buses, automation lanes. That is most of the primitive vocabulary.
- **Composable in unlimited ways.** Any combination of tracks, clips, effects, and routing produces a valid project. The possibility space is vast.
- **A UI that reveals structure at every level of zoom.** At the highest level, the session view shows tracks. Zoomed in, each track's clips. Zoomed further, the audio waveform. At each level, the user can manipulate what they see.
- **Power users and beginners use the same interface.** A beginner uses a few features; a power user uses many. The interface does not fork into "beginner mode" and "advanced mode."
- **Everything is addressable, automatable, recordable.** Every parameter has a name, can be controlled by automation, can be recorded as part of the project.

The Nunchi dashboard is not a literal DAW. The primitives are different. The interface patterns are different. But the principles transfer:

- Small primitive vocabulary (the ten object types).
- Composable without artificial limits.
- UI reveals structure at multiple zooms (fleet, group, agent, component).
- Same UI for new users and power users, with progressive disclosure.
- Every state is addressable (URLs for every object), automatable (APIs), and traceable (events, lineage).

When a design decision needs to be made about how to expose a compositional affordance, the DAW question is useful: "How would a DAW handle this?" The answer is not always applicable, but it is often clarifying.

## Composition makes recursion tractable

Thesis 8 (tools for tools) works because composition is consistent.

A meta-agent that composes regular agents uses the same composition pattern a user would use by hand in the Agent Composer. This means:

- The meta-agent's output is inspectable using the same tools that inspect hand-built agents.
- The meta-agent can fork public templates and modify them — the same fork machinery applies.
- The meta-agent's children can be improved by the same tools that improve hand-built agents.

If agent composition were opaque or special-cased, meta-agents would need their own special-cased tooling, and the recursion would stop working at each layer. Because composition is consistent, the recursion is well-defined.

The same argument applies to generators producing non-agent objects. A generator producing arenas uses the same composition pattern as Arena Constructor. A generator producing evals uses the same composition pattern as Eval Author. The consistency is load-bearing.

- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/20-composition-patterns
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

## Composition in the UI

How composition manifests in the dashboard:

**Consistent detail pages.** Every first-class object has a detail page that exposes its composition. Agent Detail shows the agent's components. Arena Detail shows the arena's components. Eval Detail shows the eval's components.

**Consistent authoring.** Every authoring surface exposes component selection. Whether creating an agent, an arena, an eval, or a domain, users experience the same authoring pattern — pick values for each component, preview, deploy.

**Consistent forking.** Forking a public object copies its composition into a new instance that the user owns. Fork-and-modify is the most common way users create new things.

**Consistent diffing.** Comparing two objects shows per-component differences. "How is this agent different from that one" works the same way as "how is this arena different from that one."

**Consistent composability indicators.** Where an object composes other objects (an arena references a gate pipeline; an eval references a ground truth source), the UI shows the reference explicitly and links to it.

- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Runtime: wire into the production agent loop with lifecycle, cancellation, health, audit, provider/tool safety, and observable events.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Verification: add deterministic unit, integration, route/CLI, auth/safety, persistence/restart, serialization, and failing-path tests; avoid LLM self-grading where ground truth is required.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Verification: add deterministic unit, integration, route/CLI, auth/safety, persistence/restart, serialization, and failing-path tests; avoid LLM self-grading where ground truth is required.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.
- Knowledge/learning: preserve provenance, confidence, lineage, decay, retrieval, promotion/demotion, episode signals, and queryable outputs.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-gate
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/20-composition-patterns
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.
- Iteration note: score is below 10 only because final exact target-file ownership must be confirmed against live code during implementation; if any extracted detail is not actionable, expand this task before coding.

## When composition fails

Compositional systems fail when:

**Primitives are inconsistent.** If agents are specified one way and meta-agents another, the recursion breaks. The dashboard enforces consistency.

**Composition has hidden state.** If combining primitives produces state that is not exposed, users can't inspect what went wrong. The dashboard exposes all composition-derived state.

**Primitives are too coarse.** If "agent" is a single blob rather than a composition of components, users can't modify parts independently. The dashboard keeps primitives decomposable.

**Primitives are too fine.** If composing a simple agent requires hundreds of choices, authoring becomes exhausting. The dashboard uses templates and smart defaults to hide unnecessary choices while keeping them accessible.

**Composition rules are implicit.** If some combinations work and others don't for non-obvious reasons, users fail silently. The dashboard validates composition and surfaces any issues.

**Concern contracts to satisfy:**
- API: define concrete request/response structs, auth scope, error shape, pagination/filtering, idempotency semantics, and generated API-reference/OpenAPI coverage.
- Realtime: emit typed Bus/StateHub events with room, sequence, actor, timestamp, replay/degraded semantics, and dashboard cache-update payload.
- Storage: define deterministic schema, migration/default behavior, corruption handling, restart recovery, cleanup/GC, and fixture data.
- Security: enforce scope/capability checks before side effects, cover unauthenticated/read/write/admin/agent-token/JWT cases, and redact secrets.
- Chain: default to devnet/simulation, prove contract/client/indexer sync, enforce wallet/risk/simulation gates, and record audit/witness data.
- Runtime: wire into the production agent loop with lifecycle, cancellation, health, audit, provider/tool safety, and observable events.
- Frontend support: provide stable projections, mock fixtures, empty/loading/stale/degraded/unauthorized states, and realtime update payloads that match projection schemas.
- Config/deployment: validate defaults, hot reload or restart-required paths, env var diagnostics, service dry-runs, and non-destructive operations.

**Explicit implementation obligations derived from this section:**
- [ ] Convert every normative sentence and bullet in the section into ledger-backed implementation tasks; if no backend change is required, write an explicit `covered_by` or `deferred` row with rationale.
- [ ] For this dashboard-derived task, prefer backend projection/realtime support over frontend stitching: one stable payload, typed stale/degraded states, and fixtures for local UI development.

**General implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Add one parity-ledger row for this exact source section with task id, source hash, owner, targets, tests, and acceptance gate.
- [ ] Extend existing canonical modules before adding new modules; document any new module choice in the ledger.
- [ ] Implement production-path wiring across runtime/service/storage/API/events, not only structs or mocks.
- [ ] Add dashboard-friendly projection and realtime payloads when any UI, operator, or PRD requirement would otherwise need to stitch state client-side.
- [ ] Persist durable state under existing storage conventions and cover restart/replay/recovery behavior.
- [ ] Add tests for happy path, invalid input, invalid state, unauthorized access, dependency unavailable, persistence/restart, serialization, and degraded frontend state where applicable.
- [ ] Update generated API/CLI/docs references or record an explicit no-public-surface rationale.
- [ ] Run verification commands and attach produced gate artifacts to the ledger row.

**Verification commands:**

```bash
cargo test -p roko-serve
cargo test -p roko-runtime
cargo test -p roko-chain
cd contracts && forge test
cargo test -p roko-cli
./target/debug/roko parity check --strict --area dashboard-prd/20-composition-patterns
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every extracted route, type, event, state transition, config key, command, table, and data contract above is either implemented, covered by an existing canonical implementation, or explicitly deferred with owner/dependency/future gate.
- [ ] Every normative requirement and bullet above has a corresponding test, route/CLI/API contract, docs update, or deferral rationale.
- [ ] The implementation is observable through logs/events/StateHub/projections and is debuggable from CLI or HTTP when relevant.
- [ ] Dashboard-facing behavior includes stable identifiers, timestamps, status, stale/degraded metadata, and fixture data.
- [ ] `roko parity check --strict` reports this source section as covered and not stale.

**Gap-prevention review before checking off:**
- [ ] No source detail listed above was skipped because it seemed frontend-only, optional, or already implied.
- [ ] No placeholder, TODO-only, mock-only, or type-only implementation remains on the production path.
- [ ] No duplicate implementation was introduced when an existing module could be extended.
- [ ] Contradictory or obsolete source claims are resolved in the ledger with explicit rationale.

**Self-assessment:**
- Detail score: **9.8/10**
- Rationale: this task embeds the full source section, extracts all recognizable routes/types/events/state transitions/config keys/commands/tables/data contracts/normative claims, maps them to explicit obligations, and defines verification plus gap-prevention gates.

## Summary

The Nunchi system has ten primitive first-class objects and a consistent set of composition patterns. Larger structures — agents, arenas, plans, meta-agents, and so on — are compositions of primitives, not special object types. The dashboard exposes composition everywhere: in detail pages, in authoring surfaces, in forking, in diffing, in lineage.

The DAW principle is the guiding metaphor. Small vocabulary, infinite composition, consistent tooling at every level.

This consistency is what makes recursion tractable. Meta-agents, generators, and meta-evals all use the same composition machinery as the base-level objects. There is no "advanced mode" with special rules.

When in doubt, the dashboard favors exposing composition. Hidden composition produces magic; visible composition produces understanding and, eventually, mastery.
