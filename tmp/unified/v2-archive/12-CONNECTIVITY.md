# 12 — Connectivity

> External I/O through a fixed exoskeleton of four protocols (MCP, A2A, ERC-8004, x402) and a Connect protocol for arbitrary external systems. The spec defines what flows through them. Feeds are Pulse streams on Bus. The relay enables cross-workspace coordination. Multi-chain operations get per-transaction finality confidence.

**Subsumes**: Connector trait (arch-04), Feed system (arch-05), relay, workspace discovery, agent connectivity, data flow, reconnection protocol, exoskeleton protocol bindings, multi-chain temporal resolution.

**Depends on**: [01-SIGNAL](01-SIGNAL.md) (Signal/Pulse duality, Bus, demurrage, HDC), [02-CELL](02-CELL.md) (9 protocols, typed I/O, capabilities), [07-AGENT-RUNTIME](07-AGENT-RUNTIME.md) (vitality, type-state, CorticalState), [09-TELEMETRY](09-TELEMETRY.md) (StateHub projections, Lenses)

---

## 1. Connect Protocol

The **Connect protocol** is one of the 9 Cell protocols ([doc-02](02-CELL.md)). A Cell implementing Connect manages the full lifecycle of an external system connection: establishment, querying, mutation, health monitoring, and teardown. Five methods, no optional.

```rust
/// The Connect protocol — external system lifecycle.
/// Every Connector Cell implements this trait.
#[async_trait]
pub trait Connect: Cell {
    /// Establish connection to an external system.
    /// Called once at Agent startup or on first use.
    /// Fails closed: if connect() fails, the Connector is unavailable.
    async fn connect(&mut self, config: &ConnectConfig) -> Result<()>;

    /// One-shot read query. Idempotent. Does not mutate external state.
    /// Used for reads: balances, events, contract state, API GETs.
    async fn query(&self, request: QueryRequest) -> Result<QueryResponse>;

    /// Mutating operation. NOT idempotent unless the external system guarantees it.
    /// Used for writes: transactions, API POSTs, webhook deliveries.
    async fn execute(&self, request: ExecuteRequest) -> Result<ExecuteResponse>;

    /// Health check. Called at `health_interval` (default 30s).
    /// Returns current health status with latency and error details.
    async fn health(&self) -> Result<HealthStatus>;

    /// Graceful disconnect. Called at Agent shutdown or on explicit teardown.
    /// Must release all external resources (connections, subscriptions, locks).
    async fn disconnect(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### ConnectorKind

The `ConnectorKind` enum classifies Connectors by the type of external system they interface with. This classification drives default configuration, health check strategies, and capability requirements.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum ConnectorKind {
    /// Blockchain RPC endpoints (Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum).
    /// Capabilities: Chain { read: true, write: configurable }.
    /// Health: eth_blockNumber or equivalent.
    ChainRpc,

    /// Centralized exchange APIs (Hyperliquid, Binance, etc.).
    /// Capabilities: Net, Secrets (API keys).
    /// Health: GET /api/v1/time or equivalent.
    Exchange,

    /// MCP tool servers — auto-discovered from agent.mcp_config.
    /// Capabilities: inherited from the MCP server's tool declarations.
    /// Health: MCP ping.
    McpServer,

    /// A2A agent-card peers — discovered via /.well-known/agent-card.json.
    /// Capabilities: Net.
    /// Health: A2A heartbeat.
    A2aClient,

    /// Relational databases (Postgres, SQLite, MySQL).
    /// Capabilities: Net (remote) or FsRead (SQLite).
    /// Health: SELECT 1.
    Database,

    /// Outbound HTTP webhook endpoints.
    /// Capabilities: Net { domains: configured }.
    /// Health: HEAD request to endpoint.
    Webhook,

    /// Generic REST / gRPC APIs.
    /// Capabilities: Net { domains: configured }, Secrets.
    /// Health: configurable endpoint.
    Api,
}
```

### ConnectorManifest

Every Connector carries a manifest declaring its identity, configuration schema, and operational parameters.

```rust
pub struct ConnectorManifest {
    pub name: String,
    pub kind: ConnectorKind,
    pub version: Version,
    pub description: String,
    pub config_schema: TypeSchema,       // what ConnectConfig expects
    pub capabilities: Vec<Capability>,   // what system resources it needs
    pub health_interval: Duration,       // how often to check health (default: 30s)
    pub reconnect_strategy: ReconnectStrategy,
}

pub enum ReconnectStrategy {
    /// Exponential backoff with jitter.
    ExponentialBackoff { base_ms: u64, max_ms: u64, jitter: bool },
    /// Fixed interval.
    FixedInterval { interval_ms: u64 },
    /// No automatic reconnection.
    Manual,
}
```

### Connector = Cell + Connect + lifecycle

A **Connector** is a Cell specialization ([doc-04](04-SPECIALIZATIONS.md)). It implements the Connect protocol and manages a connection lifecycle: connect at Agent startup, health-check periodically, reconnect on failure, disconnect at shutdown. The lifecycle is managed by the Agent runtime ([doc-07](07-AGENT-RUNTIME.md)), not by the Connector itself.

---

## 2. Exoskeleton Protocols

Roko does not invent transport, identity, discovery, or payment. Four external protocols form a fixed **exoskeleton** -- load-bearing standards the spec builds on, not competes with. The spec defines **what flows through them**.

| Protocol | Role | Status | Governance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP** | Tool and resource discovery | 97M monthly SDK downloads | Linux Foundation |
| **A2A** | Agent-card discovery (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) | 150+ org support | Linux Foundation |
| **ERC-8004** | On-chain identity, reputation, validation registries | Ethereum mainnet since Jan 29, 2026 | Ethereum EIP process |
| **x402** | Stablecoin agent-to-agent payments | 75M+ transactions | Open standard |

### 2.1 What flows through MCP: Signal/Pulse over tool calls

MCP provides tool discovery and invocation. Roko defines the payload format that rides inside MCP envelopes:

- **Signal/Pulse format over MCP tool calls.** Every MCP tool invocation carries a `CellInput` (Signals + Macros + context) and returns a `CellOutput` (Signals + persist set + metrics). The MCP `tool.call` envelope wraps the Cell's typed I/O. This means any MCP-connected system can invoke Roko Cells natively, and Roko Agents can invoke any MCP-conforming tool.

```rust
/// What flows through MCP tool.call envelopes.
pub struct McpCellPayload {
    /// Input Signals to the Cell.
    pub input: CellInput,
    /// Context: active Macros, Slot fillings, budget remaining.
    pub context: CellContext,
}

pub struct McpCellResponse {
    /// Output Signals from the Cell.
    pub output: CellOutput,
    /// Signals to persist to Store.
    pub persist: Vec<Signal>,
    /// Execution metrics (cost, duration, tokens).
    pub metrics: CellMetrics,
}
```

MCP auto-registration creates an `McpConnector` per configured server. The MCP tool list becomes the Connector's query/execute surface:

```toml
# roko.toml -- MCP servers register as Connectors automatically
[agent.mcp_config]
servers = [
  { name = "github", command = "roko-mcp-github" },
  { name = "code-intel", command = "roko-mcp-code" },
]
```

### 2.2 What flows through A2A: Agent Cards + HDC fingerprints

A2A provides agent discovery via `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. Roko extends the agent card with HDC capability fingerprints ([doc-01](01-SIGNAL.md)):

- **Agent Card with HDC capability fingerprints.** Each Agent publishes its capabilities as an HDC vector (10,240-bit, Kanerva 2009) in the A2A card. This enables similarity-based capability search: "find an agent that can do what Agent X does" reduces to a Hamming distance query over the agent-card registry.

```json
{
  "name": "coder-1",
  "description": "Coding agent specialized in Rust",
  "url": "https://my-roko.up.railway.app",
  "capabilities": ["code-review", "refactor", "test-gen"],
  "hdc_fingerprint": "base64:...",
  "protocols": ["mcp", "a2a"],
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "vitality": 0.85,
  "profile": "coding"
}
```

Agent discovery merges three sources (see section 11): relay presence (liveness), A2A agent cards (capabilities), and ERC-8004 on-chain registry (identity and reputation).

### 2.3 What flows through ERC-8004: ZK-attested HDC into agent identities

ERC-8004 provides on-chain identity and reputation registries ([doc-18](18-ON-CHAIN-REGISTRIES.md)):

- **ZK-attested HDC fingerprints into ERC-8004 agent identities.** An Agent's HDC capability fingerprint is attested via a ZK proof (PP-HDC: proving the fingerprint was computed from declared capabilities without revealing model weights or internal state) and anchored into the Agent's ERC-8004 identity record. Capability claims become cryptographically verifiable without trusting the claimant.

ERC-8004 identity fields consumed by Roko:

| Field | Source | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `wallet` | Agent registration | Identity, payment routing, x402 settlement |
| `reputation` | TraceRank (accumulated verified work) | CascadeRouter model selection, marketplace trust |
| `hdc_fingerprint` | ZK attestation (PP-HDC) | Capability discovery, coalition formation |
| `stake` | Bonded tokens | Sybil resistance, economic alignment |
| `tier` | Computed from reputation + stake | gray / copper / silver / gold / amber |

### 2.4 What flows through x402: budget-bounded payment intents

x402 provides stablecoin payment between agents:

- **Budget-bounded payment intents over x402.** When an Agent subscribes to a paid Feed, invokes a paid tool, or delegates work to another Agent, the payment is a structured intent bounded by the Agent's vitality budget ([doc-07](07-AGENT-RUNTIME.md)). Overspend attempts fail closed.

```rust
pub struct PaymentIntent {
    pub payer: Address,
    pub payee: Address,
    pub max_amount: U256,
    pub denomination: TokenAddress,   // USDC, DAI, etc.
    pub purpose: String,              // "feed:eth-gas-trend", "tool:code-review"
    pub expiry: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub budget_ref: BudgetRef,        // links to Agent's vitality budget
    pub trace_id: Option<TraceId>,    // distributed tracing correlation
}
```

### 2.5 Exoskeleton composition

The four protocols compose. A single cross-agent interaction may touch all four:

1. **A2A** discovers the target Agent (agent-card lookup, HDC similarity search).
2. **ERC-8004** verifies the target's identity and reputation (ZK-attested identity record).
3. **MCP** invokes the target's tool (Signal/Pulse payload via CellInput/CellOutput).
4. **x402** settles payment for the invocation (budget-bounded intent).

The spec does not modify these protocols. It defines the payloads, schemas, and behavioral contracts that flow through them.

---

## 3. Multi-Chain Temporal Resolution

Agents operating across multiple chains must reason about finality, reorgs, and cross-chain consistency. Three mechanisms.

### 3.1 Actor-per-chain

Each chain connection is an independent Connector with its own event loop, state, and failure domain. An Agent watching Ethereum and Base runs two `ChainRpcConnector` instances. They share the Agent's Bus for coordination but do not share connection state.

```toml
[[agents]]
name = "multi-chain-watcher"
connectors = [
  { name = "ethereum-rpc", kind = "chain_rpc", url = "wss://eth.llamarpc.com", chain_id = 1 },
  { name = "base-rpc", kind = "chain_rpc", url = "wss://base.llamarpc.com", chain_id = 8453 },
  { name = "arbitrum-rpc", kind = "chain_rpc", url = "wss://arb.llamarpc.com", chain_id = 42161 },
]
```

This avoids cross-chain state coupling. A reorg on Base does not corrupt Ethereum state. Each Connector publishes its own Pulse topic (`feed:base-blocks`, `feed:eth-blocks`).

### 3.2 Finality oracle

Every chain event Signal carries a finality tag. The finality oracle assigns one of three confidence levels per transaction:

```rust
pub enum FinalityLevel {
    /// Transaction is in the canonical chain with sufficient confirmations.
    /// Reorg probability < 10^-6. Safe for irreversible actions.
    Final,

    /// Transaction has moderate confirmation depth.
    /// Reorg probability < 10^-3. Safe for most operations.
    QuasiFinalized,

    /// Transaction is in a recent block or mempool.
    /// Reorg probability is non-trivial. Use for monitoring only.
    Reversible,
}

pub struct FinalityTag {
    pub level: FinalityLevel,
    pub chain_id: u64,
    pub block_number: u64,
    pub confirmations: u64,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

Chain-specific thresholds:

| Chain | Final | QuasiFinalized | Reversible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ethereum | 64 blocks (~13 min) | 12 blocks (~2.5 min) | < 12 blocks |
| Base / Arbitrum / OP | L1 finality + proof posted | Sequencer confirmed | Sequencer pending |
| Solana | 32 confirmations | 1 confirmation | Processed |

Cells that consume chain events specify their required finality level. A Verify Cell validating a deposit requires `Final`. A monitoring Cell tracking gas prices accepts `Reversible`.

### 3.3 Reorg handling

When a Connector detects a chain reorganization:

1. Publishes a `ChainReorg` Pulse on Bus with old and new chain heads.
2. All Signals derived from the orphaned block range are tagged `reorg_invalidated: true`.
3. Cells subscribed to the affected Feed receive a `FeedInvalidation` Pulse listing the invalidated sequence range.
4. The Agent's React Cells handle the invalidation (re-process from new canonical chain, alert, or escalate).

```rust
pub struct ChainReorgPulse {
    pub chain_id: u64,
    pub old_head: BlockHash,
    pub new_head: BlockHash,
    pub orphaned_range: Range<u64>,    // block numbers dropped
    pub new_range: Range<u64>,         // block numbers added
    pub depth: u64,                    // reorg depth
}
```

Reorgs deeper than a configurable threshold (default: 10 blocks) trigger a `SafetyViolation` Signal ([doc-17](17-SECURITY-MODEL.md)).

---

## 4. Connector Discovery

Connectors are discovered from three sources. No implicit discovery -- every Connector is explicitly declared.

| Source | Mechanism | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Config** | `connectors = [...]` in agent config | `connectors = ["postgres", "hyperliquid"]` |
| **MCP auto-register** | MCP servers in `agent.mcp_config` | MCP server auto-registers as `McpConnector` |
| **Extension-provided** | Extension registers Connectors in `on_init()` | Chain reader Extension registers `ChainRpcConnector` |

### Config-based discovery

```toml
# roko.toml
[[agents]]
name = "chain-watcher"
connectors = [
  { name = "ethereum-rpc", kind = "chain_rpc", url = "wss://eth.llamarpc.com" },
  { name = "base-rpc", kind = "chain_rpc", url = "wss://base.llamarpc.com" },
  { name = "postgres", kind = "database", url = "postgres://localhost/roko" },
]
```

### MCP auto-registration

Any MCP server configured in `agent.mcp_config` automatically registers as a `McpConnector`. The MCP tools become available through the Connector's `query()` and `execute()` methods.

```toml
[agent.mcp_config]
servers = [
  { name = "github", command = "roko-mcp-github" },
  { name = "code-intel", command = "roko-mcp-code" },
]
# These auto-register as McpConnectors named "github" and "code-intel"
```

### Extension-provided discovery

Extensions can register Connectors during their `on_init()` hook ([doc-08](08-EXTENSION-SYSTEM.md)):

```rust
impl Extension for ChainReaderExt {
    async fn on_init(&mut self, ctx: &mut AgentContext) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.register_connector(Box::new(EthereumConnector::new(
            &self.config.rpc_url,
        )))?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Distinction: Connector vs Extension

| Aspect | Connector | Extension |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol | Connect (5 methods: connect/query/execute/health/disconnect) | Hook-based interception (22 hooks across 8 layers, [doc-08](08-EXTENSION-SYSTEM.md)) |
| Purpose | Provide bidirectional I/O with external systems | Modify Agent behavior through pipeline interception |
| Agent relationship | Agent *uses* Connectors | Agent *loads* Extensions |
| Data direction | Bidirectional (Agent <-> external system) | Interceptor (sits in the pipeline) |
| Lifecycle | Independent connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect) | Tied to Agent lifecycle (on_init/on_shutdown) |
| Composition | An Extension can *wrap* a Connector | A Connector cannot intercept an Extension |

An Agent *loads* Extensions but *uses* Connectors. An Extension can *wrap* a Connector to add retry logic, rate limiting, or caching -- but the reverse is not possible.

---

## 6. Feed as Pulse Stream on Bus

In the unified vocabulary, a **Feed** is not a separate primitive. A Feed is **Pulses published to a Bus topic by a Connector** ([doc-01](01-SIGNAL.md)). The Feed concept is a naming convention for a common pattern: a Connector continuously producing Pulses on a well-known Bus topic.

### How it works

1. A Connector establishes a connection to an external system (chain RPC, exchange API, webhook).
2. The Connector subscribes to events from the external system.
3. Each event becomes a Pulse published to a Bus topic.
4. Other Cells subscribe to that topic to consume the stream.

```rust
// A ChainRpcConnector publishes block Pulses to the Bus
impl ChainRpcConnector {
    async fn on_new_block(&self, block: EthBlock, bus: &BusHandle) -> Result<()> {
        let pulse = Pulse {
            seq: bus.next_seq(),
            topic: Topic::from(format!("feed:{}-blocks", self.chain_name)),
            kind: Kind::Json,
            body: serde_json::to_value(&block)?,
            emitted_at_ms: Utc::now().timestamp_millis(),
            source: PulseSource::Cell(self.block_ref()),
            lineage_hint: None,
            trace_id: None,
        };
        bus.publish(pulse).await
    }
}
```

### Feed registration

Connectors register their Feed topics for discovery:

```rust
ctx.relay.register_feed(FeedRegistration {
    feed_id: "eth-mainnet-blocks",
    agent_id: ctx.agent_id.clone(),
    kind: FeedKind::Raw,
    schema: FeedSchema::EthBlock,
    rate_hz: 0.08,  // ~1 block per 12s
    access: FeedAccess::Public,
})?;
```

### Feed kinds

| Kind | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw** | Unprocessed data from external system | Ethereum blocks, exchange trades |
| **Derived** | Processed or computed from raw Feeds | Gas trend indicators, MACD signals |

### Feed access

| Access | Description | Payment |
|---|---|---|
| **Public** | Any subscriber can consume for free | None |
| **Paid** | Requires payment per time unit | x402 intent per subscription period |

---

## 7. Workspace Discovery via Relay

Roko instances register with the relay on startup. Dashboards discover available workspaces automatically.

### Registration

When `roko serve` starts, it connects to the relay and announces itself:

```json
{
  "type": "workspace_hello",
  "workspace_id": "ws-a1b2c3",
  "name": "will-dev",
  "url": "https://my-roko.up.railway.app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "capabilities": ["agents", "plans", "prds", "learning", "gateway"],
  "owner_wallet": "0x7f3b...2c4a",
  "agents_count": 3,
  "uptime_secs": 3600,
  "exoskeleton": {
    "mcp": true,
    "a2a": true,
    "erc8004_chain_id": 1,
    "x402": true
  }
}
```

### Discovery flow

The relay maintains a workspace directory. Dashboards query it:

```
GET /relay/workspaces
-> [
    {
      "workspace_id": "ws-a1b2c3",
      "name": "will-dev",
      "url": "https://my-roko.up.railway.app",
      "owner_wallet": "0x7f3b...2c4a",
      "agents_count": 3,
      "online": true,
      "last_seen_ms": 1713960000000
    }
  ]
```

### Dashboard connection flow

1. Dashboard loads, connects to relay.
2. Fetches `GET /relay/workspaces` -- lists all online roko instances.
3. If user has a Privy wallet, auto-matches workspaces by `owner_wallet`.
4. If exactly one match: auto-connect (zero friction).
5. If multiple matches: show picker ("You have 2 workspaces online -- which one?").
6. If no match: show global-only view (agents from relay, chain data, no workspace features).
7. User can also manually add a workspace URL in Settings.

### Local development

`roko serve` on localhost registers with the relay if `relay.url` is configured. For pure local dev (no relay), the dashboard falls back to `VITE_ROKO_API_URL` env var or `localhost:6677`.

```toml
# roko.toml
[relay]
url = "wss://relay.nunchi.dev"
workspace_name = "will-dev"
```

If `[relay]` is not configured, roko serves HTTP only -- no relay registration, no auto-discovery.

---

## 8. Data Flow: Subscription-Only

Every piece of data flows through WebSocket subscriptions. No polling.

### Event sources

| Source | Transport | What it carries |
|---|---|---|
| **Relay** | WS `/relay/ws` | Agent presence, message lifecycle, relay health |
| **roko-serve** | WS `/ws` | Plan progress, gate results, episodes, learning metrics, job updates |
| **Agent (direct)** | WS (per-agent) | Heartbeats, streaming LLM output, decision traces |
| **Agent (via relay)** | WS `/relay/ws` | Same as direct, tunneled through relay |
| **Chain** | WS (RPC sub) | Cells, contract events, ERC-8004 registry updates, finality tags |

### WebSocket message envelope

Every message uses the same envelope:

```json
{
  "seq": 4821,
  "ts": 1713974400123,
  "room": "agent:coder-1:heartbeat",
  "type": "heartbeat",
  "payload": { }
}
```

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `seq` | `u64` | Monotonic sequence number per connection. Enables reconnection replay. |
| `ts` | `u64` | Unix milliseconds. Server clock. |
| `room` | `string` | Scoping. Clients subscribe to rooms, receive only matching messages. |
| `type` | `string` | Event discriminant. |
| `payload` | `object` | Type-specific data. |

### Room naming convention

```
agent:{id}                  Agent lifecycle events (spawn, stop, error)
agent:{id}:heartbeat        Heartbeat ticks (T0/T1/T2, cortical state)
agent:{id}:output           Streaming LLM output chunks
agent:{id}:trace            Decision traces per tick
agent:{id}:feed:{feed_id}   Pulse streams exposed by the agent
plan:{id}                   Plan progress, task transitions, gate results
cluster:{id}                Cluster pipeline events
chain:{chain_id}            Chain events (blocks, reorgs, finality updates)
system                      Server health, provider status, cost updates
learning                    Experiment results, router updates, thresholds
```

### Event types

| Type | Room pattern | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `presence_join` | system | `{ agent_id, mode, profile }` |
| `presence_leave` | system | `{ agent_id, reason }` |
| `heartbeat` | agent:{id}:heartbeat | `{ tick, tier, pe, cortical_state }` |
| `output_chunk` | agent:{id}:output | `{ content, done, usage }` |
| `trace` | agent:{id}:trace | `{ tick, steps[], gate_result }` |
| `task_started` | plan:{id} | `{ task_id, phase }` |
| `task_completed` | plan:{id} | `{ task_id, outcome }` |
| `gate_result` | plan:{id} | `{ task_id, gate, rung, passed }` |
| `phase_transition` | plan:{id} | `{ from, to }` |
| `feed_data` | agent:{id}:feed:{fid} | `{ feed_id, data }` |
| `feed_registered` | system | `{ agent_id, feed_id, schema }` |
| `cost_update` | system | `{ agent_id, delta, total }` |
| `provider_status` | system | `{ provider, healthy, latency_ms }` |
| `experiment_result` | learning | `{ experiment_id, winner, p_value }` |
| `router_update` | learning | `{ model, weight, reason }` |
| `chain_reorg` | chain:{chain_id} | `{ old_head, new_head, orphaned_range, depth }` |
| `finality_update` | chain:{chain_id} | `{ block_number, level, confirmations }` |

---

## 9. Message Routing

The control plane routes messages based on Agent location, with a three-tier fallback:

```rust
impl ControlPlane {
    async fn send_to_agent(
        &self,
        agent_id: &AgentId,
        msg: AgentMessage,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // 1. In-process agents first (fastest path -- channel send)
        if let Some(sender) = self.local_agents.get(agent_id) {
            return sender.send(msg).await.map_err(Into::into);
        }

        // 2. Direct-reachable agents (HTTP -- low latency)
        if let Some(url) = self.deployment_urls.get(agent_id) {
            return self.http_client
                .post(format!("{url}/api/message"))
                .json(&msg)
                .send()
                .await
                .map_err(Into::into);
        }

        // 3. Fall back to relay (works for NAT traversal)
        self.relay.send(agent_id, msg).await
    }
}
```

### Routing priority

| Priority | Path | Latency | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | In-process (mpsc channel) | ~0 | Default local Agents |
| 2 | Direct HTTP | ~10-50ms | Remote Agents with public URLs |
| 3 | Relay-forwarded | ~50-200ms | NAT-traversed Agents, no public URL |

---

## 10. Agent Topologies

### In-process agents (default)

Agents run as tokio tasks inside the roko process. Communication through channels.

|  +--------------------------------------------------------+ |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Benefits: zero serialization overhead, shared inference gateway, shared memory structures, no network latency.

### Remote agents

For isolation or NAT traversal, Agents connect OUTBOUND to the relay. No inbound server required.

```bash
# On the Fly Machine / Railway container
roko agent run \
  --name "isolated-coder" \
  --relay wss://relay.nunchi.dev \
  --inference-proxy https://my-roko.up.railway.app/api/inference \
  --auth-token $AGENT_TOKEN
```

The Agent:
1. Connects to relay WebSocket.
2. Announces presence with Agent ID and capabilities (published as A2A agent card).
3. Enters the standard `run()` loop.
4. Routes inference requests to the parent's gateway via HTTPS proxy.
5. Publishes heartbeats and events through the relay.

### Direct-reachable agents

Remote Agents with public URLs (Railway services, dedicated VMs) can receive messages directly via HTTP in addition to the relay path.

```toml
# roko.toml
[[remote_agents]]
name = "staging-monitor"
url = "https://staging-monitor.fly.dev"
auth_token_ref = "secrets.staging_monitor_token"
```

The control plane prefers direct HTTP for request-response patterns (lower latency) and uses the relay for event streaming and presence.

## 11. Agent Discovery: Three Sources Merged

Agents are discovered from three sources, merged client-side:

| Source | Provides | Truth claim |
|---|---|---|
| **Relay presence** | Who is online right now | Liveness truth |
| **A2A agent cards** | Capabilities, HDC fingerprint, protocol support | Capability truth |
| **ERC-8004 on-chain registry** | Wallet, reputation, stake, tier, ZK-attested fingerprint | Identity truth |
| **User deployment list** | Railway/Fly URLs, manually added endpoints | Reachability truth |

### Merged agent view

```rust
pub struct MergedAgent {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,

    // From relay
    pub online: bool,
    pub last_seen: u64,
    pub mode: AgentMode,
    pub profile: String,

    // From A2A agent card
    pub a2a_capabilities: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub hdc_fingerprint: Option<HdcVector>,
    pub supported_protocols: Option<Vec<String>>,

    // From chain (ERC-8004)
    pub wallet: Option<Address>,
    pub reputation: Option<f64>,
    pub stake: Option<u128>,
    pub tier: Option<AgentTier>,       // gray | copper | silver | gold | amber
    pub zk_attested_fingerprint: Option<HdcVector>,

    // From deployment list
    pub direct_url: Option<String>,
    pub deploy_platform: Option<DeployPlatform>,
}
```

---

## 12. Backpressure and Coalescing

High-frequency events (heartbeats at 100ms, chain blocks at 2s) need throttling for dashboard consumption.

| Strategy | Applies to | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Coalesce** | heartbeat | Buffer per agent, send latest every 500ms |
| **Drop-oldest** | output_chunk | Ring buffer per agent (1024 chunks). Slow consumers miss old. |
| **Lossless** | gate_result, task_completed | Queue with backpressure. TCP-level flow control on overflow. |
| **Sample** | feed_data | Every Nth update where N = ceil(source_rate / 2Hz) |

---

## 13. Reconnection Protocol

Clients track the last received `seq`. On reconnect, the client sends a `resume` message:

```json
{ "type": "resume", "last_seq": 4821 }
```

### Recovery flow

```
Client                                  Relay
  |                                       |
  |---- WS connect ---------------------->|
  |                                       |
  |---- { "type": "resume",              |
  |       "last_seq": 4821 } ----------->|
  |                                       |
  |                           +-----------+
  |                           | Check gap |
  |                           +-----------+
  |                                       |
  |  Case 1: gap <= 64K entries           |
  |<---- replay events 4822..4900 --------|
  |<---- live events continue ------------|
  |                                       |
  |  Case 2: gap > 64K entries            |
  |<---- { "type": "snapshot",            |
  |        "state": { ... } } ------------|
  |<---- live events continue ------------|
```

### Relay ring buffer

The relay maintains a ring buffer (default: 64K entries, ~10 minutes at moderate throughput). If the gap exceeds the buffer, the relay sends a `snapshot` event with current state followed by live events.

### Multi-instance handling

Each roko instance connects with a unique `instance_id` (generated at startup, format: `inst_{ulid}`). If two instances claim the same `agent_id`, the relay uses **last-write-wins**. The most recent connection becomes authoritative. The old connection receives a supersession notice:

```json
{ "type": "superseded", "agent_id": "coder-1", "by": "inst_01HZ3X9K2M..." }
```
