# 21 — Roadmap

> Phased implementation mapping the unified spec to existing crates. Phase 0 is what works today. Phase 1 upgrades the kernel. Phase 2 builds the Graph engine and Agent runtime. Phase 3 adds autonomy, safety, and the agent economy.

**Source**: `tmp/architecture/18-roadmap.md` (rewritten for the unified model). Phases updated to reflect Pulse/Bus kernel, predict-publish-correct, Hot Graph engine, type-state Agent, CaMeL IFC, arenas, and brain export.

---

## 1. Phase 0 -- Current State

What is already built, working, and wired. This is the foundation the roadmap builds on.

### 1.1 Crate Mapping

| Crate | Unified Concepts | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `roko-core` | Signal (Engram), 6 protocols (Store/Score/Verify/Route/Compose/React) | Kernel, stable |
| `roko-agent` | Agent specialization: 9-step pipeline, 5+ LLM backends, MCP, tool loop, safety | Dispatch wired |
| `roko-agent-server` | Agent sidecar: `/message`, `/stream`, `/predictions`, `/research`, `/tasks` | Wired |
| `roko-orchestrator` | Graph execution (plan DAG, parallel executor, merge queue) | Wired via orchestrate.rs |
| `roko-gate` | Verify protocol: 11 gates, 7-rung pipeline, adaptive thresholds | Wired, called per-task |
| `roko-compose` | Compose protocol: prompt assembly, 9 templates, VCG auction, enrichment | Wired |
| `roko-learn` | Learning Loops 1+2: episodes, cascade router, experiments, efficiency, bandits | Fully wired |
| `roko-neuro` | Memory specialization: knowledge store, tiers, HDC fingerprints, distillation | Wired |
| `roko-dreams` | Loop 3 partial: NREM/REM/Integration phases built, no runtime trigger | Built, not triggered |
| `roko-conductor` | 10 watchers, circuit breaker, diagnosis | Wired into executor |
| `roko-runtime` | ProcessSupervisor, event bus, cancellation | Wired into PlanRunner |
| `roko-primitives` | HDC vectors, tier routing | Fully wired |
| `roko-daimon` | Affect engine, somatic markers, dispatch modulation | Wired per-task |
| `roko-serve` | ~85 HTTP routes, SSE, WebSocket on :6677 | Wired |
| `roko-cli` | All CLI commands + ratatui TUI (F1-F7 tabs) | Main entry point |
| `roko-fs` | FileSubstrate (JSONL), GC, layout | Stable |
| `roko-std` | 19 builtin tools, mock dispatcher | Stable |
| `roko-mcp-code` | Code-intelligence MCP server | Wired |
| `roko-index` | Parser + graph + HDC indexing | Built |
| `roko-chain` | Chain witness primitives, marketplace, validation registry | Partial |

### 1.2 Working End-to-End Flows

The following flows work today via CLI:

1. **Self-hosting loop**: `prd idea` -> `prd draft` -> `prd plan` -> `plan run` -> gate validate -> persist results -> `plan run --resume`
2. **Research-enhanced planning**: `research enhance-prd` -> `prd plan` with research context
3. **Automatic replan**: Gate failure triggers `build_gate_failure_plan_revision` (Loop 2)
4. **Auto-plan on publish**: `prd.auto_plan` config triggers plan generation when PRD is published
5. **Interactive monitoring**: `roko dashboard` TUI with F1-F7 tabs
6. **HTTP control plane**: `roko serve` exposes ~85 routes for external callers
7. **Agent sidecar**: `roko agent serve` with real LLM dispatch

### 1.3 What Phase 0 Lacks (In Unified Vocabulary)

- No **Pulse/Bus kernel** -- event bus exists in roko-runtime but is not promoted to a kernel trait alongside Store
- No **predict-publish-correct** pattern -- learning happens but is not structural via Bus pub/sub
- No **demurrage** on knowledge Signals -- tiers exist but no balance/decay mechanics
- No **Heuristic kind** -- knowledge Signals have no when/then/falsifier structure
- No **EFE routing** -- CascadeRouter uses LinUCB bandits, not Expected Free Energy (Friston 2006)
- No **Observe protocol** (Lens system) -- monitoring exists but is not protocol-based
- No **Trigger protocol** -- triggers are hardcoded, not declarative
- No **Connect protocol** formalization -- connectors exist but are not protocol-based
- No **Graph authoring** -- plans are TOML task lists, not typed Graphs with edges
- No **Rack** abstraction -- no parameterized Graphs
- No **TypeSchema validation** at load time
- **Loop 3** (dream cycle) is built but has no runtime trigger
- **Loop 4** (structural adaptation) does not exist
- On-chain registries are specified but not deployed

## 2. Phase 1 -- Kernel Upgrade (Near-Term)

Promote Pulse and Bus to kernel-level, wire predict-publish-correct, add demurrage, introduce Heuristic kind, upgrade routing to EFE, trigger the dream cycle, and formalize the Observe/Trigger/Connect protocols.

### 2.1 Pulse/Bus Kernel

**Goal**: Pulse is a first-class data type alongside Signal. Bus is a kernel trait alongside Store. All real-time behavior flows through Bus. See [doc-01](01-SIGNAL.md).

| Wire Cell lifecycle events as Pulses on Bus | `crates/roko-orchestrator/` | M | BroadcastBus |

### 2.2 Predict-Publish-Correct

**Goal**: Every operator (Scorer, Router, Composer, Gate) publishes predictions as Pulses, subscribes to its error topic, and updates. Learning is structural via Bus pub/sub (Friston 2006, active inference). See [doc-02](02-CELL.md).

|---|---|---|---|
| Implement `CalibrationPolicy` React Cell | `crates/roko-learn/src/calibration.rs` | M | Bus |

### 2.5 EFE Routing

**Goal**: Replace LinUCB bandits in CascadeRouter with Expected Free Energy (Friston 2006). EFE naturally balances exploration (epistemic value) and exploitation (pragmatic value) while being cost-aware. See [doc-02](02-CELL.md).

## 6. Dependency Graph

```
Phase 0 (Current State)
    |
    v
Phase 1 (Kernel Upgrade)
    |-- 1.1 Pulse/Bus kernel
    |-- 1.2 Predict-publish-correct ----------> depends on 1.1
    |-- 1.3 Demurrage
    |-- 1.4 Heuristic kind
    |-- 1.5 EFE routing
    |-- 1.6 Dream cycle trigger
    |-- 1.7 Observe protocol + 10 Lenses
    |-- 1.8 Trigger + Connect protocols
    |-- 1.9 TypeSchema validation
    |
    v
Phase 2 (Graph Engine + Agent Runtime)
    |-- 2.1 Hot Graph engine -----------------> depends on 1.1, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9
    |-- 2.2 Type-state Agent
    |-- 2.3 CognitiveWorkspace --------------> depends on 1.2
    |-- 2.4 StateHub -------------------------> depends on 1.7
    |-- 2.5 Five named surfaces --------------> depends on 2.4
    |-- 2.6 Rack -----------------------------> depends on 2.1
    |-- 2.7 5-tier SPI
    |-- 2.8 Marketplace v1 ------------------> depends on 2.1, 2.7
    |
    v
Phase 3 (Autonomy + Safety + Economy)
    |-- 3.1 L4 self-evolution ----------------> depends on 2.1
    |-- 3.2 CaMeL IFC -----------------------> depends on 1.1
    |-- 3.3 5-head corrigibility -------------> depends on 3.2
    |-- 3.4 On-chain registries
    |-- 3.5 Arena system ---------------------> depends on 3.4, 1.2
    |-- 3.6 Brain export/import --------------> depends on 1.3
    |-- 3.7 Cross-agent knowledge ------------> depends on 3.4, 3.6
```

### Parallel Tracks

- Phase 1 tasks (1.1-1.9) are largely independent except 1.2 depends on 1.1.
- Phase 2.2, 2.3, 2.7 are independent of 2.1 (Graph engine).
- Phase 3.2 (CaMeL IFC) and 3.4 (on-chain registries) are independent and can start early.

### Critical Path

```
Phase 1.1 (Pulse/Bus) -> Phase 1.2 (predict-publish-correct)
    -> Phase 2.1 (Hot Graph) -> Phase 2.3 (CognitiveWorkspace)
    -> Phase 3.1 (L4 self-evolution)
```

This is the shortest path to full self-evolution capability.

## 7. Migration Strategy

### 7.1 Naming: Code vs. Spec

The unified vocabulary applies at the spec and documentation level. Existing Rust code retains its current names for backward compatibility. Type aliases bridge the gap:

| Spec Name | Code Name | When to Rename | Bridge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signal | `Engram` | Phase 2 (Graph engine migration point) | `type Signal = Engram;` |
| Pulse | `Envelope<E>` | Phase 1 (promote to first-class) | New struct replaces |
| Bus | `EventBus` | Phase 1 (promote to kernel trait) | New trait replaces |
| Cell | Module/trait impl | Phase 2 (Cell trait introduced) | New trait |
| Graph | Plan/tasks.toml | Phase 2 (Graph TOML replaces plan format) | Migration tool |
| Store | `Substrate` | Phase 1 (add type alias) | `type Store = Substrate;` |
| Score | `Scorer` | Phase 1 (add type alias) | `type Score = Scorer;` |
| Verify | `Gate` | Phase 1 (add type alias) | `type Verify = Gate;` |
| Route | `Router` | Phase 1 (add type alias) | `type Route = Router;` |
| Compose | `Composer` | Phase 1 (add type alias) | `type Compose = Composer;` |
| React | `Policy` | Phase 1 (add type alias, note: now takes Pulses) | Breaking change |
| Observe | -- (new) | Phase 1 (new trait) | -- |
| Connect | `Connector` | Phase 1 (formalize existing) | -- |
| Trigger | -- (new) | Phase 1 (new trait) | -- |
| Demurrage | -- (new) | Phase 1 (add to Engram) | New fields |
| Heuristic | -- (new) | Phase 1 (new Kind variant) | New variant |

### 7.2 Plan-to-Graph Migration

Existing `tasks.toml` plans will be automatically convertible to Graph TOML:

```toml
# Old: tasks.toml
[[task]]
name = "implement-feature"
prompt = "..."
depends_on = ["research"]

# New: graph.toml
[[block]]
id = "implement-feature"
type = "agent"
config = { prompt = "..." }
inputs = [{ from = "research", edge = "output" }]
```

A migration CLI command handles conversion: `roko plan migrate <dir>`. The existing plan format continues to work during Phase 2 (the executor detects format and dispatches accordingly).

### 7.3 React Protocol Breaking Change

The `React` (formerly `Policy`) protocol changes from operating on Signals to operating on **Pulses**. This is the only breaking protocol change. The migration path:

1. Phase 1: `React` trait defined with Pulse-based API alongside existing `Policy` trait.
2. Phase 1: Existing policies migrated incrementally.
3. Phase 2: `Policy` trait deprecated.
