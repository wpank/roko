## Problem

DP3's strictness ladder steps a task type down one level only after two windows in a row with UCB95(θ) < θ_max/2
(`crates/roko-gate/src/audit/feedback.rs::step`, `QUIET_WINDOWS = 2`; left unchanged by bug-1e97dc, per q-394b7f).
With no events, Wilson's UCB95 is z²/(n_eff + z²), so a quiet window needs n_eff above 149.8 at θ_max = 0.05. A
window holds `window_units = 200` green units or 24 hours, whichever comes first, and at the default ρ = 0.10 it
audits about 20 units, fewer still in θ's sample after phase B (`phase_b_rate = 0.5`). Even ρ = 0.5, the cap, audits
only about 100. So at the defaults a task type's level can go up but never comes back down. Since bug-1e97dc, a
level goes up on evidence (LCB95 above the limit: 3 false greens or 2 gaming findings in 20 audited units).

A one-way ratchet keeps every rare evidence window. The chance that the LCB95 clause fires at least once in 50
windows (binomial, n audited units per window) is:

- at θ = 0.02 (under half of θ_max): 0.30 at n = 20, 0.56 at n = 10;
- at γ = 0.01 (half of γ_max): 0.57 at n = 20, 0.19 at n = 10.

Each firing costs one level for good: V2 adds A2 re-runs, V3 a B1 hidden suite (model spend), and V4 B2 mutants.

## Why it matters

Goal `cybernetic`, epic spec-7a71d6 stage 4: gap-d76b1b turns audits on at 10% by default. bug-1e97dc stopped the
ladder climbing on noise. This is the remaining way it over-escalates at the defaults, more slowly but with no way
back. It is the same family as q-c02c36, where a clippy-dirty crate never steps down.

## Where

- `crates/roko-gate/src/audit/feedback.rs::step`: the quiet run (`Rung.quiet`, `QUIET_WINDOWS`) and the step down.
- `crates/roko-core/src/config/audit.rs::AuditConfig`: `window_units` 200, `window_hours` 24, `rho` 0.10,
  `phase_b_rate` 0.5, `theta_max` 0.05.

## Current state

At 4783dbe91 (bug-1e97dc), a rate steps its task type up when LCB95 is above its limit at any n_eff, or when n_eff
reaches `min_n_eff` (73 for θ, 189 for γ) and UCB95 is above the limit. Step-down is as before. Nothing pools quiet
windows or decays a level, so the only way down at the defaults is editing the vault's `ladder.json` by hand.

## Why this needs Will

Each option trades verify spend on healthy task types against how fast a level returns once a real problem is fixed:

1. Keep the ratchet: the operator lowers levels by hand.
2. Pool the quiet run: add up n_eff and events over the consecutive windows since the last step, and step down
   once the pooled UCB95(θ) < θ_max/2 (about 150 audited units, 8 to 15 default windows).
3. Step down after K windows in a row with no evidence (no LCB95 above either limit), for a fixed K such as 10.
4. Close windows per task type by n_eff rather than by green units.

## Notes

- q-394b7f's decision reads "Step-down is unchanged (two windows with UCB95(theta) < theta_max/2, so n_eff >= 150)".
  It saw the n_eff requirement. This item records that a default window never meets it.
- Do not change `eps_floor` (locked at 0.05, 7113) or ρ.
- Found while doing bug-1e97dc (2026-10-16).

## Decision (2026-10-18, Will)

Option 2: pool the quiet run. Add up n_eff and events over the consecutive windows since the last step, and step down once the pooled UCB95(θ) < θ_max/2 (about 150 audited units, 8 to 15 default windows). gap-d76b1b (audits on at 10%, decision 7103) may follow once this lands.
