WarmPool container exists but is not wired to the provider bridge, so reviewers cold-start after gates instead of being pre-spawned during gate execution.

Imported without verification from:
- `tmp/archive/plan-audit-2026-09-23/03-ACTIONABLE-TASKS.md#Tier 3: Polish (Nice-to-have for full mori parity)`
- `tmp/archive/plan-audit-2026-09-23/01-GAP-MATRIX.md`

How to verify: grep WarmPool non-test usages.
